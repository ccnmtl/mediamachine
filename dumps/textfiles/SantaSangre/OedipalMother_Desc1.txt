This bizarre Argentinian melodrama about madness, merger, and family intrigue is a sequel to the apocalyptic western &#34;El Topo,&#34; reportedly John Lennon&#39;s favorite film.  Bloody violence abounds in this tale too, which like its predecessor views the unrelenting savagery of life&#39;s drama from a masculine and even macho point of view.  <br>	Jodorowski&#39;s aesthetic resembles the theaters of the absurd (Ionesco) and cruelty (Grotowski), the grotesque and exploitation genres of British and American movies (e.g., Russell, Lynch and Tarantino), the macabre horror films of Dario Argento, and the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone.  The mythical allusions reveal a deeply conflicted neo-Catholic religiosity, a Christian eschatology articulating a gothic vision of the suffering, vulnerability, and masochism of the corporeal Jesus as a violent yet castrated man trapped in the cyclical traumas of a lawless, fatherless world, doomed to become the sacrificial victim.<br>	Ostensibly about a mother/son union gone awry (cf. &#34;Psycho&#34;), the movie traces the post-traumatic trajectory of a young boy (Fenix) in a circus family who witnesses his knife-thrower father brutally amputating the arms of his unfaithful mother.  He is rescued from an asylum by his mother, 12 years later.<br>	In this scene, he repeats the trauma as agent, sacrificing a young woman he loves to satisfy the possessive oedipal craving of his vindictive mother.  The event is surrounded by psychotic elaborations in which fantasy and reality, sadism and masochism, are thoroughly confounded.  One can&#39;t help thinking or wishing that he might have killed his mother instead, finishing what his father did not, or that his sacrifice of a loved one is actually, in fantasy, matricidal.
