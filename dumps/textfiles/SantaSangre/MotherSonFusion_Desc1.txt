In the continuing saga, still grieving the sacrifice of his erotic object, Fenix (Axel Jodorowsky) returns to the bizarre domestic `folie a deux' with his mother, a binding contract in which he devotes his arms to her (an extreme form of identification?)  By so doing he also indulges an `eros a tergo' (intimacy from behind), and deprives himself of foregrounding, confrontation, separation, and freedom.  <br>	The mother is ruthlessly dependent on her son, chastising and controlling him yet paradoxically infantile "in his arms."  He, too, is infantile in the sense of being primarily a bodily thing, servile to her control, and mutely identifying with prelinguistic animals.
