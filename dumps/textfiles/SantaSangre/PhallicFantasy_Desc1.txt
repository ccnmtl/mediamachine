The conflictual link to the circus is triggered by a parade, which launches the serpentine, elephantine phallus (cf. Dumbo and Lynch's "The Elephant Man").  The zoophilia of Fenix merges with his delusions of grandeur -- Adlerian over-compensation for his virtual castration, which repeats for him the paternal severing of maternal limbs.  The fantasy of an out-of-control, massive masculinity restores at least one of the dismembered limbs.  It also merges potential sexuality with potential violence, which in turn justifies the repressive return to reality and normal servility.  The situation on the balcony suddenly reverses the seer and the seen, suggesting a certain exhibitionism that is at odds with the indentured service.
