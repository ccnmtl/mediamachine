John Singleton&#39;s remake of the 1971 Blaxploitation classic, &#34;Shaft&#34; depicts the nephew of the film&#39;s namesake&#39;s struggle for justice within and without the New York City Police Department. After the racist and spoiled son of a real estate tycoon kills a black man outside a night club and escapes prosecution by fleeing the country, Shaft leaves the NYPD in pursuit of the criminal as a vigilante. The key the case against  the killer is the one woman who witnessed the event (Toni Collete), a bartender named Diane who has been in hiding since the trial. In this scene, Shaft, who has at long last found his witness, is confronted by Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a drug dealer who despises Shaft and who seeks Diane on behalf of the killer. <br><br>This film obviously deals with issues of race in an interesting manner, since it is premised on a racially motivated killing witnessed by a white bartender and the vigilantism of a black police officer. However, gender and familial bonds also play a role in Shaft. When Shaft first abducts Diane from her Queens residence, her mother quickly calls her brothers to come to the rescue. Meanwhile, Hernandez seems indifferent to the OK Corral-style shoot-out that is raging in this ordinarily quiet Queens neighborhood until a stray bullet kills his younger brother. At this moment, Peoples becomes hysterical and directly involved in the violence at hand that prior to his brother&#39;s death seemed banal to him. What are the connections between violence, protection, family and safety that this segment of &#34;Shaft&#34; comment upon?
