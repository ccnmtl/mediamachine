The always delightful Ben Stiller plays ridiculously good-looking Derek Zoolander,  the hegemonic leading edge in male modeling for several years, and only now challenged by an androgynous, psychedelic counter-hegemonic rival, Hansel (the surprisingly effective Owen Wilson).  The movie rotates around this rivalry, a folie a deux of competitive mutual identification between the declining star and the rising star.  Each is of ambiguous sexuality, and each is famous for a particular kind of interpellating &#34;look,&#34; in Derek&#39;s case &#34;Blue Steel&#34; (perhaps reference to Kathryn Bigelow&#39;s movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis). Derek&#39;s decline somehow makes him obvious prey to Mogatu, infamous designer, who conspires with Derek&#39;s manager, Murray Ballstein of Ball&#39;s Models, (played by Stiller&#39;s father, the famous standup and Seinfeld denizen, Jerry) to brainwash Zoolander into assassinating the president of Malaysia at a fashion show!  Meanwhile, Derek&#39;s story is being covered by Matilda, comely spinster journalist from Time mag.<br><br>In this scene, Derek&#39;s roommates, perhaps of less ambiguous sexuality, entertain him after his humiliating loss to Hansel, jousting playfully with each other, then taking him for a ride to the gas station, where an unexpected tragedy unfolds.  Derek presides at the aftermath, announcing his retirement to undertake charity activities, but Hansel stages a timely, disruptive appearance, stealing some of the Zoolander thunder.<br>-JMB
