Jennifer (Camille Keaton), in search of R&R at a secluded riverside cabin, is harassed by a gang of sadistic country goons, who pursue her in their motor boat, then assault her brutally and terrorize her repeatedly.  Eventually they try to kill her.  She feigns masochistic capitulation, as though enjoying their attention, then bravely wreaks her revenge in an intelligent, patient, and carefully plotted manner.  After hanging the attempted assassin, then surgically removing the manhood of the primary instigator in her bathtub (what lies beneath?), she proceeds to the water sports. (jmb)<br><br><br><br>
