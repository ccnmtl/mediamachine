Note the use of popular culture as a courting device on the part of both furry rascals, even though they are dressed in tuxedos, suggesting the hybrid hi/lo issue  had already appeared in the U.S. in the early post-war years (cf. McLuhan?s `Mechanical Bride? at that time). ?Chippendale,? the suppressed signifier that Disney splits, also contains both levels of culture: at once it is antique furniture and stripping gogo dancer.</P><P>The Doppelganger theme of two similar, cohabiting, ambiguously male creatures has been eroticized in film by writer/directors such as Fassbinder (`Despair,? 1978), John Schlesinger (`Midnight Cowboy,? 1969), George Roy Hill (`Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,? 1969),  and Sidney Furie (`Little Fauss & Big Halsey? 1970).  This ambiguous buddy pattern reappears in watered down form in TV?s `Cisco Kid,? `Lone Ranger,? `Range Rider,? and `Batman,? as well as in `The Odd Couple.?  The connection of film to TV here is captured in Rex Reed?s description of  Schlesinger?s movie as ?Batman and Robin on wheels? (Halliwell 1990, p.603).</P><P>            But the theme is particularly common in juvenile pop culture:  Mole & Ratty, Bert & Ernie, Bananas in Pyjamas (suggestive), Tellytubbies,  Pee Wee?s Playhouse (see MM clips), Beavis & Butthead, South Park, and the egregious music hall spoof, `Monty Python.?  It is also to be found in fantasy literature, especially of  the Bilbo/Frodo or Harry/Ron type, which seems to have been immensely popular in the last few years, in which the doubling is cemented in a bond mystified by magic.</P><P> The two boys ?n a gal theme, while it is not absent from the Hollywood film, or European art classics, such as Bergman?s `Wild Strawberries,? about which Erik Erikson has written compellingly.  But it is more a tradition in French movies: Truffaut?s  ?Jules et Jim? (1962), reprised in the 70s by ?Pourquoi Pas? and  Blier?s  `Going Places? (recently mimicked flagrantly by the over-rated  `Y Tu Mama Tambien? (2002).  In U.S. cinema, one might note Araki?s racier version of the threesome in the 90s cult movie ?Splendor.?  </P><P>The homoerotic ending of the latter reminds us of  the final slapstick denouement in Chip ?n Dale, which unpacks the tacit dimension of the two boys ?n a girl triangle, while not missing the opportunity to get in a homophobic parting shot!  In all the movies, the woman in the middle seems remarkably assertive ? what is often called ?Madonna ethics? in media studies these days.  Quaintly repeating the viability of the assertive woman at the apex is Guinnevere, selflessly bedding Lancelot and Arthur simultaneously in `The Mists of Avalon? (2002)</P><P>Homoeroticism and homophobia were pitted against each other in much 60s culture ? witness David Crosby?s `Triangle? on the darker third (live) album by Crosby, Stills and Nash. ?Why can?t we go on as three??  Crosby gives a psychodynamic clue to the sexual acting out: ?Your father stands at your shoulder / Face like ice, a little bit colder.?  The emotionally remote father and the warmer, coddling mother were widely thought at the time to constitute the typical family constellation engendering homosexual tendencies in the son (cf. Nevitt Sanford?s `Self and Society? in the late 60s). </P><P>Later commentators on the history of  gender and sexuality roles trace such concerns to the end of the war, when a dramatic ?crisis of masculinity? surfaced.  At this point, like Hercules returning home after his mythic labors, men put down arms and faced disability, unemployment, loss of their heroic features, generalized fear of their martial prowess, and repression of their professionally desublimated aggressivity.  Such a radical pacification was captured both literally and symbolically in the image of men taking up domestic chores again (see Miriam Lewin?s `In the Shadow of the Past,? 1984) --  James Dean?s dad (Jim Backus) in `Rebel Without a Cause? is depicted in the family kitchen wearing an apron, which is somehow supposed to account for the Jimmy?s affection for the rather overtly sexualized, gun-wielding Sal Mineo, and his puzzling ambivalence about Natalie Wood.</P><P>
