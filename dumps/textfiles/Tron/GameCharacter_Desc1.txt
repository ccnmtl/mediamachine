Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), computer programming prodigy, gamer, and video arcade owner, enters a digital world where his alter-ego, Clu is subjected to the tyrrany of the Master Control Program (MCP). MCP has become a dictatorial force within the program and forces the digital selves to renounce their users and submit to his control instead. Flynn, seeking justice from his former employer, the computer company that has willed MCP to power and that stole his programs, becomes enmeshed in the digital community&#39;s efforts to replace MCP with the benevolent Tron. <br><br>In this clip we see Flynn, in the black robe, attempting to control his virtual self, Clu, who is being tortured by the MCP. We see Flynn&#39;s manipulation of Clu, and yet, when Clu experiences pain and fear, Flynn experiences frustration. Moreover, Clu seems unaware that he is not in control of his actions. The fragmentation of one&#39;s identity and the idea of creating an online alter-ego are explored here, which seems particularly interesting since this film was made over ten years before &#34;Internet&#34; was a household word.
