Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), a "user" or real person, taunts the Master Control Program (MCP) one too many times, and the powerful program sucks him, literally, into the digital world. Flynn's fate is to become a gladiator in the digital world ruled by the MCP and his henchman, Sark (David Warner). <br><br>The separation of the digital identity from the "user" or real life identity of the players of games is explored here. Sark worries that since Flynn is a user that he has powers beyond those of his own, since he is a computer generated entity. MCP insists that this is not the case. Meanwhile, other digital creations worry that the users have completely abandoned them and that they are now at the mercy of the MCP. What do the viewpoints of these various "selves" tell us about identity formation? How does the digital identity gain power or overpower the real-life user? When does the user become the superflous identity?(jlh)<br>
