The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has returned to the present age (circa 1991) from the future, but this time he has been reprogrammed. Instead of attempting to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of her son, John (Edward Furlong), he is to be his protector. In this clip, John is being pursued by both a new Terminator, the T1000, who wants to kill him as well as Schwarzenegger&#39;s Terminator, who wants to save him from the other Terminator. <br><br>Wordlessly, the benevolent and stoic Terminator plucks John from imminent death and with an extremely large gun destroys the threat. However, the T1000 rises from the flames and continues its pursuit. The Terminator, a metal cyborg with a carapace of human skin, serves as the father figure in this film while the protean T1000 is the enemy, changing forms throughout. In her &#34;Cyborg Manifesto,&#34; Donna Harroway explores the role of the Terminator as a prototype of masculinity, and it is interesting to consider in light of her discussion the role of the villainous T1000, whose identity is less fixed. The T1000&#39;s various roles serve as a foil to the family dynamic that develops between John, the Terminator and Sarah in that it poses a threat to this typical American family unit in the form of meddling police, security guards and other authority figures from the public sector. <br><br>Consider also the gender of the two cyborgs. Why is it important that they both be male in their exterior appearances? Particularly the fact that the T1000, who theoretically can take any human shape, chooses to spend the majority of the film as a male police officer must be of some significance.<br><br>Compare the actions of the Terminator in this clip to his behavior in the Terminator clip in this database. How has he changed? The two situations are structurally quite similar, but the characters are different. How is masculinity represented differently in each clip?
