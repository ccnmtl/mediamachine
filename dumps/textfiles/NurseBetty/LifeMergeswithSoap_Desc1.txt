Betty (Rene Zellweger) is an unhappily married waitress whose desire to qualify as a nurse is thwarted by her faithless, abusive, drug hustling husband Del (Aaron Eckhart).  Her medical aspirations get displaced into an obsessive fantasy about the widower surgeon, David (Greg Kinnear) on the hospital soap opera, `A Reason to Live.&#39;  <br><br>In this rather gruesome scene, two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) who suspect Del has cheated their boss pose as potential drug customers, and Del brings them home to discuss the deal.  He doesn&#39;t realize that Betty&#39;s night out has been cancelled and instead she is upstairs watching a videotape of a crucial episode in her favorite soap. <br><br>Betty&#39;s fate in this movie is a complex psychological one, later described by an expert as a post-traumatic &#34;dissociative&#34; disorder, and comparable perhaps to Louise&#39;s delayed reaction to sexual assault.
