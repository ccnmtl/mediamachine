This abstract, highly constructed, experimental video, is the only joint venture of a major painter (in the grotesque tradition) and her daughter (an East Village film-maker).  In it, the transcripts of the Joseph Mengele and Joel Steinberg trials (the former for Nazi atrocities, the latter for fatal child abuse) are chopped up and mixed in with pieces of Freud's article, `A Child is Being Beaten.'  The bits and pieces, like dismembered body parts, are recited repeatedly, in triplets, by film-maker and actor friends of Ida and Beth whose talking heads are separated from their bodies by traditional portrait camera position.  <br><br>The child's haunting refrain, "I'm not a bad person," echoes through the fragmented testimonies, paralleled by repeated shots of what looks like the rhythmic, criss-cross girders of the Brooklyn Bridge, rapidly flying by a car window.  Both threads seem to function to suture the pieces together. (jmb)<br><br>
