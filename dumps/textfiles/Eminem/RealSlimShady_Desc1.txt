Eminem isn&#39;t an average rapper. He&#39;s phenomenal.  The impending release of the The Slim Shady LP, his first set on Aftermath/Interscope Records, already has underground hip-hop heads fiending for Eminem. Chock full of dazzling lyrical escapades that delve into the mind of a violently warped and vulgar yet extremely talented wordsmith, the 14-cut collection contains some of the most memorable and demented lyrics ever recorded.  </P><P>For Eminem, his potentially controversial and undoubtedly offensive songs will strike a chord with a multitude of hip-hop loyalists who believe they have little to lose and everything to gain.</P><P>&#34;I&#39;m not alone in feeling the way I feel,&#34; he says. &#34;I believe that a lot of people can relate to my sh*t--whether white, black, it doesn&#39;t matter. Everybody has been through some sh*t, whether it&#39;s drastic or not so drastic. Everybody gets to the point of &#39;I don&#39;t give a f**k.&#39;&#34;</P><P>Those words are more than just a slogan for the Detroit resident. &#34;I Just Don&#39;t Give A f**k&#34; and &#34;Brain Damage&#34; are the two songs comprising Eminem&#39;s initial single from The Slim Shady LP. Each tune is sure to paralyze meek listeners with their relentless lyrical assault. Produced primarily by long-time collaborators FBT Productions, the Slim Shady LP also features beatwork from Aftermath CEO Dr. Dre. The N.W.A. alum handled beats for &#34;My Name Is&#34; (the second single), &#34;Guilty Conscience&#34; and &#34;Role Model.&#34;</P><P>But like many other rappers, Eminem&#39;s rise to stardom was far from easy. After being born in Kansas City and traveling back and forth between KC and the Detroit metropolitan area, Eminem and his mother moved into the Eastside of Detroit when he was 12. Switching schools every two to three months made it difficult to make friends, graduate and to stay out of trouble.</P><P>Rap, however, became Eminem&#39;s solace. Battling schoolmates in the lunchroom brought joy to what was otherwise a painful existence. Although he would later drop out of school and land several minimum-wage-paying, full-time jobs, his musical focus remained constant.</P><P>After being thoroughly disappointed and hurt by the response Infinite received, Eminem began working on what would later become the Slim Shady EP -- a project he made for himself. Featuring several scathing lines about local music industry personalities as well as devious rants about life in general, the set quickly caught the ear of hip-hop&#39;s difficult-to-please underground.</P><P>&#34;I do say things that I think will shock people,&#34; he says. &#34;But I don&#39;t do things to shock people. I&#39;m not trying to be the next Tupac, but I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;m going to be on this planet. So while I&#39;m here, I might as well make the most of it.&#34;  (from his official website)
