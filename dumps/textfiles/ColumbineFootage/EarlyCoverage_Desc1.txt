Sherry Higgins, a Columbine parent, is the protagonist of this CNN account of the massacre that occurred on April 18, 1999. Ms. Higgins, whose daughter was a member of the now famous Trench Coat Mafia, begins her testimony describing feelings of panic and helplessness as she beseeched the police to, &#34;blow the shooters away.&#34; Then, she learned that the assailants were two friends of her daughter whom she described as &#34;good kids.&#34; We have all heard accounts of the torment that Columbine Seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold endured from peers and that their violence was an act of vengeance against the popular students who marginalized and mocked them. However, in this clip we are confronted with the anger and disbelief expressed by parents when their child&#39;s school becomes as dangerous as the Gaza Strip. <br><br>Columbine, on many levels, could be perceived as a parents&#39; worst nightmare; whether your child is the victim or a perpetrator, it is unsettling to imagine that you have lived beside a person who will be a part of such a disaster in any capacity. Were the parents of the Klebold and Harris completely oblivious to their sons&#39; plotting?   Were they apathetic or even encouraging of their children&#39;s behavior? What is the role of social and emotional development in their decision to perpetrate such a crime? How does the climate of their family, their community and their psyche affect such choices?<br><br>Ms. Higgins&#39; initial response to the sequence of events as they were in motion was one of violence as well. Her wish to blow the shooters away is an impulse that many of us likely had when we first heard of the tragedy. What is it about being a bystander to such an event that is so completely absorbing? Like being unable to look away from a car accident, the country was paralyzed by the coverage of Columbine in television, newspapers and radio. How do events such as these mediate our concepts of who we are and what type of place our world is to live? (jlh)<br>
