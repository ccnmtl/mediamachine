Only 24 hours after the massacre at Columbine High School, police were bombarded with accusations that they could have acted more quickly and more effectively in curtailing the carnage within the school. How did the media's reporting of such criticisms effect the ability of the public to process what had happened at Columbine? It seems that no one could believe that two young men who were barely old enough to be registered with the selective service could really be responsible for such carnage. Blame the police who were slow to react, blame ineffective safety measures at the school, blame the faculty for not keeping their heads in a disaster. Yet, it seems ironic that the media, so often blamed for seizing upon anything violent to flash on the screen or plaster on the front page would be scapegoating every other player in the Columbine sage. <br><br>The Columbine tragedy points to many disconnects in our highly mediated culture. We are eager to criticize the media for using sex, violence and scandal as the pillars of programming yet we are bored by anything less. Meanwhile, the media is busy trying to find someone to blame for allowing this situation to get out of control. There is no suggestion that perhaps this situation was out of control long before Klebold and Harris went to school armed. (jlh)<br>
