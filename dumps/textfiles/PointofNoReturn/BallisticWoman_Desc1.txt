Bob (Gabriel Byrne) is her teacher, lover and mentor and in this clip, we see her final &#34;test&#34; before she is free to begin her new life as a civilian who is at the beck and call of the federal government as a killer.<br><br>The romantic structure of the clip takes us from a dream date to a tender goodbye via a murder and chase scene through a restaurant kitchen. When Maggie is presented the gift of the gun, her face falls and she knows that she must change her persona from the object of a courtship to the perpetrator of a murder sanctioned by the state.
