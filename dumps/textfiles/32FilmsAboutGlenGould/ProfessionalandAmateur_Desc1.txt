This French Canadian independent film about the Canadian virtuous pianist Glenn Gould, is structured in terms of 32 brief vignettes, each accompanied by one of Gould&#39;s many recordings. Each illustrates a single facet of this very private and obsessive but enormously talented musical enigma. The movie creates an elegaic portrait juxtaposing musical inventions, tensions between recording technology and live performance, personal insights of friends and relatives, and moments of loneliness and  psychopathology. The 32 sections mirror the structure of Bach&#39;s Goldberg Variations, the CBS recording that made Gould famous in the Fifties. (adapted from imdb) <br><br><br>Canada,<br>part subtitled
