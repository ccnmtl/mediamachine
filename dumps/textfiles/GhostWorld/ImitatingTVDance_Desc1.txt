The movie starts with a dated modern dance number, where the participants (one female, many male) are masked.  But the camera pans back and we realize that this is just a TV program.  Several diverse people in an ordinary apartment complex -- perhaps lower middle class and of limited means -- are seen in their rooms, perhaps watching the same program.  The camera finally settles on a teenage girl, Enid, who is alone dancing in front of the TV practising her moves, imitating the woman dancer&#39;s movements.<br>-JB
