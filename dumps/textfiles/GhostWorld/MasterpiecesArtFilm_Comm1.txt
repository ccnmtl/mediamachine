Enid (Thora Birch, of American Beauty) and Becky (Scarlett Johansson, of The Horse Whisperer) are best friends who are graduating from high school.  They are mildly depressed, blase counter-school slackers, deeply engaged with hanging out, appearance, everyday life, popular culture, and slagging off everyone around them (especially adults).  Their fantasies are driven by an intense sexual frustration -- they have no boyfriends, and seem to both have disasterous dating records.<br><br>While their college-bound classmates pursue their upwardly mobile trajectories, the two friends resign themselves to getting menial service jobs, in the anticipation of being able to rent a modest apartment together and move out of their parents&#39; homes -- although Enid seems to be dragging her feet on the plan.<br><br>Meanwhile they cynically torment everyone around them: Enid&#39;s nerdy Dad, their friend Josh (Brad Renfro) who works in a convenience store, and Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a cranky dork whose sole recommendation is a rather adolescent expertise in old vinyl, especially &#34;roots&#34; music.  The girls start out by stalking him, but soon Enid strikes up an ambiguous and overinvolved friendship with him, around which much of the rest of the movie revolves.<br><br>Needless to say, the intimations of heterosexuality here take away from the homosocial intimacy of the two girls.  Becky resents this alienation, interpreting it as a reluctance to move in together, and the friendship starts to spiral downward.  She bursts Seymour&#39;s bubble, which may give hope to the girls&#39; ailing friendship.<br><br>This rather successful, though partial adaptation of Daniel Clowes&#39; downbeat comic book classic of the same name is directed by the man who made his name with an award-winning biopic on San Francisco comic book artist extraordinaire R. Crum.  Keep on truckin&#39;, Terry!<br><br><br><br>Further commentary on this scene:<br>Later in the movie (0.58 -- not excerted here), Enid gets her revence, by introducing &#34;high concept&#34; into her (still cartoonish) racist found-object.  This hubristic capitulation is of course punished, as the school is horrified and requires the teacher to give her a failing grade in the class (1.23).<br><br>If you watch the whole movie, note how (around 0.53, the blues club scene) Seymour is confronted with the contrast of genuine blues (ragtime style) and derivative blues-rock (the electric band, &#39;Blueshammer&#39;), and apparently his refusal to accomodate costs him his pick-up.<br><br>Zwigoff thus draws another parallel, not just between art and film but between both of those and music.  Seymour may be a &#34;low&#34; kinda guy, but his taste is purely &#34;high culture&#34; in his insistence on informed and sophisticated expertise about roots music.<br>-JB
