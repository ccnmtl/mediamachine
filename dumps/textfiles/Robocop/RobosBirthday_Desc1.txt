After his untimely death at the hands of a law-enforcement robot run amok, Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is reborn as a cyborg police officer, Robocop. Here we witness his death and rebirth through his own eyes. The cyborg, though personified and regarded as consious by the humans around him, is not treated exactly as an adult &#34;person.&#34; Is Robocop a person, anyway? As he dies, we are privy to some of his memories as a human; how much of this will linger with him in his new incarnation? Is it desirable to have a robot with emotional baggage? Although this scene depicts his birthday, he has, in a sense, already lived. How can his creators control what elements of his old life are transferred into this new unhuman, indeed, superhuman one?(jlh)
