Two intimate friends (John Dall and Farley Granger) living in a swanky Manhattan apartment decide to commit a Dostoevskian or (more accurately) Nietzschian murder, to fulfill or test out the existential teachings of their favorite college professor (Jimmy Stewart).  They pick as their target a classmate who is the boyfriend of Brandon's ex-girlfriend.  They have invited the parents of the victim, the girlfriend, and other friends of the family to dinner, at which they intend to keep the body present in an ornate chest that they use as the buffet table!<br>	The movie is based on the Leopold and Loeb murder case, which was a notorious front-pager throughout an extended trial in which the homosexual relationship of the murderers was a controversial element in the deliberations (which crime was worse -- clearly the one that has no name).<br>	Note that there are no cuts -- the camera moves around the subjects continuously without any editing, creating an uncannily seamless effect (cf. the long shot at the start of Altman's `The Player,' included in the Media Machine).<br><br>-JMB<br>
