The average rapper wouldn&#39;t be able to grace the pages of Rap Pages, VIBE, Rolling Stone, Spin, The Source, URB and Stress and go on a national tour months before their major-label debut album is released. Then again, Eminem isn&#39;t an average rapper. He&#39;s phenomenal.</P><P>The impending release of the The Slim Shady LP, his first set on Aftermath/Interscope Records, already has underground hip-hop heads fiending for Eminem. Chock full of dazzling lyrical escapades that delve into the mind of a violently warped and vulgar yet extremely talented wordsmith, the 14-cut collection contains some of the most memorable and demented lyrics ever recorded.</P><P>But like many other rappers, Eminem&#39;s rise to stardom was far from easy. After being born in Kansas City and traveling back and forth between KC and the Detroit metropolitan area, Eminem and his mother moved into the Eastside of Detroit when he was 12. Switching schools every two to three months made it difficult to make friends, graduate and to stay out of trouble.</P><P>Rap, however, became Eminem&#39;s solace. Battling schoolmates in the lunchroom brought joy to what was otherwise a painful existence. Although he would later drop out of school and land several minimum-wage-paying, full-time jobs, his musical focus remained constant.</P><P>&#34;Infinite was me trying to figure out how I wanted my rap style to be, how I wanted to sound on the mic and present myself,&#34; he recalls. &#34;It was a growing stage. I felt like Infinite was like a demo that just got pressed up.&#34;</P><P>After being thoroughly disappointed and hurt by the response Infinite received, Eminem began working on what would later become the Slim Shady EP -- a project he made for himself. Featuring several scathing lines about local music industry personalities as well as devious rants about life in general, the set quickly caught the ear of hip-hop&#39;s difficult-to-please underground.</P><P>&#34;I had nothing to lose, but something to gain,&#34; Eminem says of that point in his life. &#34;If I made an album for me and it was to my satisfaction, then I succeeded. If I didn&#39;t, then my producers were going to give up on the whole rap thing we were doing. I made some sh*t that I wanted to hear. The Slim Shady EP, I lashed out on everybody who talked sh*t about me.&#34;</P><P>Set to take the hip-hop world by storm with his unique lyrical approach and punishing production, Eminem and his The Slim Shady LP are sure to have listeners captivated.</P><P>&#34;I do say things that I think will shock people,&#34; he says. &#34;But I don&#39;t do things to shock people. I&#39;m not trying to be the next Tupac, but I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;m going to be on this planet. So while I&#39;m here, I might as well make the most of it.&#34;</P><P>(www.eminem.com)
