Adapted from the short story by Phillip K. Dick, this underworld &#34;noir&#34; science fiction masterpiece is known for being one of those movies marking the beginnings of  &#34;postmodern&#34; cinema. In a futuristic culturally hybridized L. A., in an era when Earth ships have colonized many other planets, Deckard (Harrison Ford) is an FBI-type operative hired to hunt down and elimiate the few remaining man-made &#34;replicants.&#34;<br><br>These genetically engineered quasi-humans of superior strength and intelligence possess a &#34;planned obsolesecence&#34; - that is, they expire after a short life-span. However, after working as slaves in outer space, a few have survived long enough to return as a renegade gang, intent on finding their maker, reengineering themselves to prevent their demise, and transforming their memories to resemble those of regular human beings.<br><br>Deckard&#39;s detective/hit-man quest is successful in finding and wiping out all but the last two replicants. He falls in love with one and hunts down the other - Roy (Rutger Hauer). In this scene at the end of the movie, although Deckard has succeeded in driving a nail through Roy&#39;s hand, the hunted turns on the hunter and pursues him to the top of a Chrysler-like art deco building, replete with gargoyles. The denouement is then played out, thick with implications for the way in which we think of life and death, male gladiatorial combat, and the inner/outer dialectic of colonization. (jlh)<br><br>
