Deckard (Harrison Ford), a Blade Runner whose job it is to kill replicants, has been in pursuit of a group of renegade cyborgs who have escaped to earth from &#34;off-world&#34; where they perform tasks undesirable to humans. Roy Batty, the leader of this group, is the last one remaining and in this scene, one of the film&#39;s final moments, Deckard and Roy face off.<br><br>Although throughout the film Deckard has been looking for Roy, in the end it is he who is being chased. As Deckard runs to escape from Roy, he is also running from a part of himself that is stoic, programmed and cold, much like a cyborg. As a bounty hunter, Deckard must maintain repose in order to do his distasteful job. However, Roy extends his hand to Deckard, saving him from death and showing that he has, in fact, gained an understanding of what it means to be alive, a state we might not ascribe to Roy as a replicant. Moreover, Roy has learned to have emotions, or so his soliloquy suggests, which further clouds the replicant/human distinction between the two men. <br><br>This clip, and the relationship between humans and the technology we create in our own image challenges the notion of what criteria make a human being a person. Is the way a replicant learns and solicits emotional responses so different from the way a person does? Roy has spent his brief life (replicants live only for a few years) in service of persons and during this time he has learned that he wants to continue living, something that seems very human. <br><br>The breakdown of the distinctions between Deckard and Roy speak to the similarities between human and cyborg, but also to the duplicitous nature of the self. Tyrell, the creator of the replicants says of them that they are &#34;more human than human.&#34; Thus, Roy possess masculine traits to a degree that exceeds those of a human male and his passion to continue living is twice as strong as Deckard&#39;s. Watching Roy die, Deckard begins to question just how different he and this replicant are, and where within himself his own nature has come from. What programmed Deckard to act the way he does? Often in science fiction, the difference between humans and cyborgs or robots translate very well into conflicts within the human self, and this film uses this vehicle to explore Deckard&#39;s unpleasant and frightened existence.<br><br>Masculinity in Blade Runner is fairly traditional, despite the fact that the film takes place in the future. The dystopia of Blade Runner&#39;s world is an appropriate backdrop for the depressed, haggard and unenlightened human race that inhabits it. <br>
