Supposedly, Pee Wee has won a dinner for two at the local Hawaiian restaurant, and can&#39;t decide who to take with him on the date: Miss Yvonne, Luann, the large lady, the Captain or Tito?  He would like to please everyone and, like most young people driven by virtue ethics (girls, according to Gilligan), he seems unable to think of any criterion by which to decide.  Orifices abound here, with various oral and anal allusions, that can be combined into the ins and outs of the alimentary canal narrative. These segue into homoerotically suggestive remarks and images.  Exactly what decision is Pee Wee trying to make, why can&#39;t he decide, and how will the cabana boy help him, do you think?  Afterwards, we return to images of orifices -- a red skin hole (move over Jim Carrey) and then putting (it) into the golf hole.  <br>-JMB
