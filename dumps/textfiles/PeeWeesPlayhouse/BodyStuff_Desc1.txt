Pee Wee, in the rather hysterical antics that start the show, cavorts around the playhouse, exhibiting its various animistic accessories.  Note the odd beating of Pee Wee&#39;s nether parts with Chairy&#39;s arms, which is censored surreptitiously by the camera sliding up, so contact is off screen.  The suggestive motion is, however, more fully depicted toward the end of the clip.  The first of these two episodes features an odd hairpiece that stages a surprise entrance and hasty exit.<br>-JMB
