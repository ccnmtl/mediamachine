The Brothers Quay are Pennsylvania born identical twins, living and working rather reclusively in London, England. They have developed an abstract, highly modernist kind of stop-motion animation out of the techniques pioneered by the great surrealist Czech animator, Jan Svankmajer (originator of claymation). <br>	The excerpts here are from `The Cabinet of Dr.Svankmajer&#39; (1984), the Quays&#39; tribute to the originator of this kind of animation (Jan Svankmajer), and `The Epic of Gilgamesh,&#39; subtitled `&#34;That Unnameable Little Broom&#34; (1985).<br>	Note the compulsively precise use of color, texture, music, focus, and camera movement, synthesized in gorgeous yet metaphysically mysterious and disturbing scenarios.  There are frequent references to arithmetic, geometry, science, and technology -- often in artistic terms (e.g. technical graphics). Their explorations are surreal in the sense both of de Chirico (moody, anomic, estranged, object-centered) and of Magritte (contrary, jokey, philosophical, nightmarish). There are also hints of the topsy-turvy logic of Lewis Carroll, who also fascinated Svankmajer.<br>	Many of the illustrations of technique or scientific apparatus seem to be potential comments on the very machinery used by the animators to achieve this aesthetic product. <br>-JB
