Svankmajer is famous chiefly for his magnificent &#34;Alice&#34; (in Wonderland).  His style was popularized in Peter Gabriel&#39;s prize-winning MTV videos, &#34;Big Time&#34; and &#34;Sledgehammer,&#34; although these days it is Nick Park of &#34;Wallace and Gromit&#34; fame who seems to benefit most from this exquisitely time-consuming tradition of film-making.<br><br>Ironically, the Quays are best known as the inspiration for Peter Greenaway&#39;s &#34;Zed and Two Noughts&#34; (link?) in which identical twin brothers undergo dreadful, traumatic loss linked to a zoological park -- some have argued that since these characters kill themselves at the end of the movie, they are actually the two &#34;noughts&#34; (zeros), not a very well executed compliment to the Quays on Greenaway&#39;s part!<br><br>The brothers refer to themselves as the Brothers Quay rather than the Quay Twins partly to avoid confusion with the infamous Kray twins, who were convicted of brutal murders in the UK in the 60s.
