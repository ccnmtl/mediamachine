The opening credits of Octopussy are truly a sight to behold. The montage features various configurations of women and guns, sometimes the women are holding guns, other times the guns are spouting forth the flaccid bodies of women. Although these images are hilarious bordering on ridiculous, they serve as a sort of generic template for the archetypal Bond Girl. The Bond Girl, is a fabulous young and gorgeous woman with a highly suggestive name whose career as an actress tends to go absolutely nowhere. <br><br>In this brief clip, the relationship between Bond and women is reinforced through a variety of images. The credits begin with a red laser image of Bond caressing the side of a supine woman, which segues into a man twirling a woman by the arms and legs, a dance that looks like a cross between a figure skating move and bit of WWF choreography. These women, like the female characters in Bond films, seem particularly suited to posing as objects of desire, but in truth they are often forebearers of destruction. <br><br>In a recent article in "Vanity Fair," four categories of Bond girls were identified, and of these four only one was not completely objectified: A comrade with whom Bond joins forces in order to combat whatever threat is currently impinging on the safety of Western Europeans. The women in this clip, many of whom have no face, are fragments of a female body, which is in most cases what women represent in Bond films. This clip satirizes the role of the Bond girl ad absurdum.
