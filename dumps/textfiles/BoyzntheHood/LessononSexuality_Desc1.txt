In this clip, Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his father Furious Styles (Lawrence Fishburn) discuss sexuality over a plate of barbeque and a haircut. Tre has recently been at his friend Doughboy&#39;s (Ice Cube) house celebrating his release from jail and Doughboy&#39;s mother has sent home a plate for Furious. Tre describes to his father his first sexual experience, which is shown in a flashback. Furious berates him for not using condoms, and scorns his boastfulness, stupidity and feelings of immortality. <br><br>In this scene it is interesting to speculate as to the veracity of Tre&#39;s story. At first, it seems legitimate enough, but when we see his girlfriend&#39;s grandmother ascent the stairs, meat cleaver in hand, we wonder how much of his tale is hyperbole. What is the significance of the haircut during this exchange between the father and son? Tre indirectly confronts his dad with his &#34;luck&#34; and his emerging sexuality, which trigger for Furious some of the issues he dealt with during the era of Tre&#39;s untimely birth. (jlh)<br>
