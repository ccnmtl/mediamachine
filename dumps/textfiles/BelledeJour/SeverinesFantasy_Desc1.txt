Severine (Catherine Deneuve) is an upper-class housewife who spurns physical intimacy with her husband and indulges instead in erotic fantasies. Eventually, Severine's musings lead her into afternoon work as a prostitute in a high-end Parisian brothel, unbeknownst to her husband. In this clip, Severine imagines a pastoral country scene turning into an S & M exploit. Her alter-ego disappears when her husband enters the scene. What might provoke Severine to sublimate her sexuality when with her husband yet revel in it while alone or with total strangers? (jlh)
