Holden (Ben Affleck--perhaps the namesake of Salinger's Caufield?) has fallen for Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) but does not realize that she is a lesbian. In this clip, he misinterprets her serenade as a swan song for him. Holden's best friend and partner in the authoring of comic books, Banky (Jason Lee), ever-sarcastic and antagonistic, reaps great pleasure from the realization that his friend's amorous intentions toward Alyssa have been thwarted and the fact that the two of them have unknowingly entered a lesbian night club.<br><br>The eroticizing of lesbianism by heterosexual males is an obvious theme in this clip. However, a less obvious subtext that is present here and becomes more overt later in the film is the homosexual undertones in the relationship between Banky and Holden. The joy that Banky derives from Holden's misfortunes with women seem to be more than mere banter. The shared moment between Alyssa and her paramour could be compared with the moment shared by Banky and Holden, who, like so many bumbling male duos, seem to be stuck with each other rather than scoring big with the ladies. How is the relationship between these two men depicted against the backdrop of this all-female environment? (jlh)<br><br><br><br>
