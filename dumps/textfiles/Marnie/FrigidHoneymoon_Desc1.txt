Marnie (Tippi Hedren) has married her employer, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery) and the two honeymoon on a cruise at sea. On this evening, Mark learns in no uncertain terms of Marnie&#39;s disdain for the affections of men. She flees from the bedroom and describes to him her disgust at the thought of being touched by a man. <br><br>This clip sets the tone for Marnie&#39;s relationship with Mark, and in the film he proceeds to inquire into her unusual past. Hedren masterfully plays Marnie&#39;s bottled rage at men, her incredulous nature at their desires. (jlh)<br>
