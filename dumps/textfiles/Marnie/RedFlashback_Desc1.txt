In this clip, we learn the source of Marnie&#39;s revulsion at the touch of men. Her mother, a former prostitute, has tried to protect her daughter from the memories of her sordid past and the girls&#39; own harrowing experience at the hands of one of her clients. <br><br>The efforts of Marnie&#39;s mother to prevent her daughter&#39;s recognition of her involvement in the events of that night seem to serve several purposes. One obvious effect is that Marnie&#39;s failure to recognize the event makes it seem unreal to her mother as well, and presumably Marnie&#39;s disdain for men would prevent her from ever following in her mother&#39;s footsteps. However, the recognition of this event also suggests the differentiation that takes place between mother and child (see Jessica Benjamin, Freud, Bataille, etc.). How does the denial of this event alter the mother-daughter relationship? What do Marnie&#39;s feelings toward men signify when examined through this prism? (jlh)<br>
