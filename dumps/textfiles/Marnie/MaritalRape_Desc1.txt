In this clip, estranged honeymooners Marnie (Tippi Hedren) and Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), argue before bed as they presumably have for the duration of their cruise at sea. Marnie, who despises the touch of men, endures the sex act with her husband. As he removes her robe she enters into a daze and the wave of shock that washes over her can only be escaped by a suicide attempt into a swimming pool.<br><br>Marnie&#39;s lifeless expression as Mark kisses her is reminiscent of Klimt&#39;s famous painting &#34;The Kiss,&#34; that was later characterized by D. H. Lawrence as an expression of the woman&#39;s ennui or disdain for her male lover. Like the woman in &#34;The Kiss,&#34; Marnie longs to escape her husband&#39;s embrace, but also, it seems from her glib response to his inquiry about her suicide, from the clutches of another sort of trauma. Her plunge into the smaller pool rather than the wide ocean seems particularly symbolic. (jlh)<br>
