Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two unemployed musicians on the run: they have witnessed the mafia killing of the St. Valentines Day massacre, and need to go underground pronto.  Joe hits on the idea of changing genders.  Since they have their instruments with them, they manage to slip into an all-girl touring band at the railway station.  All kinds of comedic situations ensue, of course, all the more poignant when both guys fall for the ukulele player, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe).<br><br>-jmb
