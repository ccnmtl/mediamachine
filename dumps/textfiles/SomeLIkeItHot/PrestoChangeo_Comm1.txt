Some critics have voted this the best American comedy ever made, and it is certainly one of the funniest, with Wilder at his hectic, hilarious, and risky peak (of &#34;One, Two, Three&#34;).<br><br>This is not to be confused with the earlier (1939) jitterbug Bob Hope vehicle of the same name (later retitled &#34;Rhythm Romance&#34;), which also starred Gene Krupa.<br><br>Note in both cases, &#34;hot&#34; refers to jazzy, intense music- dance as it was seen in the first half of the century.  In Some Like It Hot, it&#39;s Marilyn (Sugar) who says she likes her music &#34;hot&#34; - - adding her characteristic sizzle.  Julie Andrews reprises theline in Victor/Victoria, expecially in the song &#34;Le Jazz Hot Baby&#34;, perhaps not coincidentally another gender-imposture movie.<br><br>In post-code Hollywood, issues of sex were often dealt with elliptically via the metaphoric richness of music, capitalizing on its reputation for inciting young men to risky action and leading young women astray (G.B.Shaw&#39;s definition of dancing: &#34;a vertical expression of a horizontal lust&#34;).<br><br>There is a pervasive sense of guilt and repression throughout the film, even to the point of sexual dysfunction.  Homophobia is linked to murder - - to the original killing.  Once the lads are on the train, they return to the scene of the crime - - to love, the St. Valentines theme, with its obvious risk of discovery and hence death. The linking of sex and death is common in cinema of the 50&#39;s.<br>-jmb
