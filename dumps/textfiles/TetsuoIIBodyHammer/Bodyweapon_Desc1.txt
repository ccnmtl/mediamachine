Sequel to &#34;Tetsuo 1: Iron Man&#34; this second episode traces various transformations of bodies -- into robots, servile clones, and in this case Tetsuo&#39;s own body changing into a weapon. The process seems driven by a kind of virtual reality experience of stimulation with images that is engineered by a malignant &#34;master&#34; via a female employee.<br>That time has the Iron Man transforming into cyberkinetic gun when a gang of vicious skinheads kidnap his son. When the skinheads capture him, they begin to experiment on him...speeding up the mutative process!
