In this Tetsuo excerpt, the gun has a prosthetic quality, being associated or fused with the human body.  What does this suggest about a) how weapons might or should be conceived?  b) the decontextualized way we normally think about weapons as separate objects, say, in comparison to tools? (Note the title of Tetsuo 2, which likens the cyborg body to a hammer).<br><br><br>CAMERA/GUN   What is the role of the camera in this excerpt? What does violence directed toward the camera mean? Can the camera be seen as a threat, and if so how does that threat compare with the threat of a weapon like a gun? [On the history of guns and bullets, see Manuel deLanda's War in the Age of Intelligent Machines (link?), and the connection between photography and death made famously in Roland Barthes' Camera Lucida (link).]<br>	We are used to the association of cameras and death, e.g. in the familiar video relay from the nose-cone of a descending smart bomb during the Gulf War (link), or in the fatal accident that killed Princess Diana (link?) <br>	Think of some parallels between cameras and guns, as indicated by Paul Virilio in War and Cinema where he shows the intertwined histories of war and cinema:<br><br>	-- both are "prosthetic" in the McLuhan's sense of extending	and amplifying technologically a particular function of the human body<br>	-- both are "mechanical" (they are subject to malfunction etc.)<br>	-- the technology involved in both is quite complicated, and requires special training and expertise on the part of the operator<br>	-- they are both oriented to a particular "event"<br>	-- they are both "loaded"<br>	-- they both involve a sudden onset, a "switching on"<br>	-- This onset is accompanied or announced by a distinct sound<br>	-- they are both used to take "shots"<br>	-- they are both "pointed" at a "target," which is typically a human body or bodies (note the title of the movie)	<br>	-- they both require an acute, accurate perceptual activity on the part of the user, a sharp "looking"<br>	-- the selection of the target requires an act of identification and perhaps even typification/categorization<br>	-- the position of the subject or operator is sharply contrasted with the position of the "object," this antithesis being set up by the introduction of the device (camera, gun) into a situation<br>	-- the "object" of attention may well try to avoid or escape the precise, calibrated attention of the operator, and/or divert attention away from the self to an other<br>	-- both bring about a definite effect, which involves marks or "inscriptions"<br>	-- the effects could be positive or negative, offensive or defensive; they can serve as intrusive or protective instruments<br><br>	It might be of interest to look at other movies where cameras and death are linked -- Blow Up, Foreign Correspondent, Rear Window, Belly of the Architect, Rising Sun, Enemy of the State, End of Violence, Sliver, Photographing Fairies, etc.  What is the range of relations between photography and killing depicted in these movies?<br>	In applying the analysis of camera/weapon similarities to education, how might it be possible to illuminate potential relations between knowledge and violence? Consider Foucault's notion of Power/Knowledge and how it may suggest new ways of looking at education (something Foucault himself did not carry out, but which is represented in the work of Valerie Walkerdine in Julian Henriques et al., Changing the Subject (2nd edn, Routledge 1999) and in Psychoculture 1995, 1(1).
