This exceptionally beautiful, exquisitely slow Iranian classic is by the great director of &#34;A Taste of Honey,&#34; &#34;The Cameraman,&#34; etc., who is a frequent presenter in the course `Film as Art&#39; at Teachers College (thanks to Jamshid Akrami, T.C. faculty member, who is also Kiarostami&#39;s friend and translator).  In this work from the middle period of Kiarostami&#39;s oeuvre, a film director (you got it) is in the course of making a movie using untrained village people, which turns out to be a trial for him and limitlessly comic for us.  In the course of the movie within a movie, much is revealed about characters, relationships, the effort after realism in film, the complexities of village life, and the tension between filmmakers and performers, for example, as in the desire of some villagers that their daily round be represented accurately.</P><P>This eponymous scene, which comprises the end of the film is cinematically marvellous, and reminiscent of the way Antonioni draws his films to a close (e.g. The Passenger, Red Desert).  The scene features a young man and woman who are playing a courting couple in the movie.  Although in the movie within the movie, other characters surround the couple, as Kiarostami draws his movie outside the movie to a close, he quickly removes everyone else the cast, the crew, the director and leaves just the two protagonists locked in monolog.</P><P>Will the mysterium coniunctonis be resolved?  Why and how does he remove them from the social context of courtship?  What is the role of voice and silence in the denouement?  Why does Kiarostami reduce film to landscape painting?  How does he use temporality, and what does he indicate about time and space?  What is he saying or showing about heterosexual love, and what about cinema itself?</P><P>
