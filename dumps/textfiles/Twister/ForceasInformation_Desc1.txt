Dorothy, a device that &#34;Storm Chasers&#34; hope will supply them with information on the nature of tornadoes if they can launch her into the eye of one, is preparing for her first flight. Jo and Bill Harding, former leaders of this group, now estranged to the point of divorce, risk their lives and their pickup to drive Dorothy toward a giant black twister in the cornfields of Oklaholma. In this clip, the pursuit of information and this machine bring the couple back together. The wacky band of &#34;Storm Chasers,&#34; deferential to the Hardings, are almost a band of children, or at least the &#34;lost boys&#34; of these two scientists who are themselves thrill-seekers of a sort.
