Alexandra (Debra Winger) is a federal investigator who is trailing Catharine (Theresa Russell), a woman who she believes marries wealthy men, kills them for their estates and then assumes a new identity in order to move on to her next victim. Alexandra pursues Catharine to Hawaii where the two are in the same scuba class. The implied intimacy of the mouth-to-mouth exercise as well as Alexandra&#39;s (or &#34;Jessica,&#34; her undercover pseudonym) envious yet wanton admiration of her new friend, &#34;Rennie&#34; suggest a connection developing between the two beyond a professional one.
