Brandon Teena, unbeknownst to his new friend Candace, was born Tina Brandon. In this scene, Brandon and Candace have a flirtation at the bar and when Brandon gets up to buy cigarettes, a hulking man decked out in hunting garb takes his seat. When Brandon returns, a fight ensues. Although the two men are quickly separated, Brandon still manages to hurl angry epithets at his opponent and walks away proudly with a black eye. In the background, John, one of Candace&#39;s group, sizes up Brandon and even comments on the smallness of his hands as he prepares to initiate this neophyte into more than just a high school clique.
