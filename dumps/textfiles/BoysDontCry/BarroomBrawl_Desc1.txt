In this clip, Brandon Teena meets the last group of friends he will ever have. Brandon, nee Tina Brandon, is constantly shaping his identity as a male. Women are instantly attracted to him, as is Candace  (Alicia Goranson) in this clip. The vulnerability that stems from the novelty of his male identity make Brandon more boyish than manly, which creates a contrast between Brandon and macho thugs John (Peter Sasgaard) and Tom (Brendan Sexton III). Despite the differences that exist between Brandon and his counterparts, he is hungry for their acceptance and desperate for their cues for masculine behavior.<br><br>Brandon and Candace discuss names changes as a way to change identity, but in reality, Brandon already knows that it takes more than a name change to initiate oneself into a new gender. Brandon&#39;s predicament is replete with the contradictions that come with changing identities. His need for role models is mediated by the importance of keeping them at arms length, as is his desire for intimacy with women. His sensitivity and naivety prevent him from truly being one of the guys, yet we sense that these same traits are what set him apart and make him so attractive to women. Throughout the film, there is an underlying tension, a threat of violence of impending harm that may come to Brandon as he lives out his fantasy. What is so daring and frightening about Brandon&#39;s choice of identity? How does it compare to Dil in The Crying Game or to Dorothy Michaels in Tootsie? (jlh)<br>
