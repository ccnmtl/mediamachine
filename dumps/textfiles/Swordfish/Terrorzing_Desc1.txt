Shot in flesh-tingling close-up, this tense, rather mean spirited movie reveals fascinating parallels to our era of volatile urban terrorist panic, although it was completed before 9-11. A parolee hacker (Hugh Jackman) takes on a challenging assignment masterminded by a ruthless hard guy (John Travolta) to steal electronically a government slush fund of 10 million -- codename &#34;Swordfish&#34; (cf. the Marx Bros.)  Halle Berry (woefully exploited) is the undercover double agent.<br><br>     In this scene, Travolta uses terrorist strategies in a stand-off with the police, revealing the cross-over between major crime and political terrorism. He leads in with a bizarre monologue about movies, suggesting (dramatic irony?) that while movies are unrealistic, reality often models itself on movies.<br><br><br>-JMB<br>
