"Being the One is like being in love," the Oracle (Gloria Foster) tells Neo (Keanu Reeves). It's something you just know. But for Neo, who has just learned that everything he once took for granted as true is actually a complex simulation created by a computer program called the Matrix, "just knowing" anything seems impossible. In this clip, Neo listens to the Oracle's prophecies in a state of doubt and confusion. His own psychological state causes him to interpret her words according to the lack of stability he feels. <br><br>When the Oracle tells Neo that he already knows what she is going to say, the viewer gets a sense that perhaps he knows because regardless of what she says, he will believe his own instincts, which keep him in doubt of his singular status. The Oracle's job seems to be more about putting Neo into the fighting spirit, making him want to defy her predictions than it is about actual prescience. The idea of being told who we are and how we feel can be very comforting, as it surely was to Neo before his world was turned around by this new information. However, reconciling this sense a destiny with the control we can exercise over our lives is reminiscent of certain differentiation that begins in childhood and extends through adolescence and adulthood.  <br>
