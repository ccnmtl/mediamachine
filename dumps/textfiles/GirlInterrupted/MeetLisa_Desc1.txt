Based on the novel of the same title, &#34;Girl, Interrupted&#34; chronicles the 18 month long stay of author Susanna Kaysen (portrayed by Winona Ryder) in the mental institution, Claymoore, after a suicide attempt that included chasing a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka. Susanna befriends the other residents of Claymoore, including Lisa (Angelina Jolie) whom we meet in this clip. Lisa seems to energize herself through either entertaining or exasperating those around her. <br><br>The story of &#34;Girl, Interrupted&#34; is standard for this genre; a girl finds herself diagnosed with a mental illness, experiences a period of self-reflection and then is &#34;cured&#34; and returned to society at large. In this clip, Susanna seems both shocked and enamored of Lisa. Could she be considering the fact that she might end up being a &#34;regular&#34; at Claymoore? Would it be so bad to be Lisa, seemingly confident, sexy and sociopathic? (jlh)<br>
