This video is excerpted from an interview on a CNBC news magazine program. This particular episode centers around a wrestling competition aired on pay-per-view television called &#34;The Ultimate Fighting Championship.&#34; This discussion centers around the viewership of this program: who are these people and why are they watching? Aggression and masculinity are identified at the onset of the program as two of the themes that wrestling brings to mind, and it is interesting to note that the host of the show, Mike Jerrick, rather aggressively insists that children are the primary audience of wrestling. <br><br>While listening to each of the participants discuss their points of view on the subject, consider his investment in wrestling as a sport and as a performance. Why might Robert Meyrowitz deny so fervently that kids do not watch his program? Why does Bob Peters, ironically from the organization Morality in Media, insist that men &#34;get off on&#34; the violent aspect of wrestling when Professor Broughton states that the viewers identify with the victim? Would a young viewer be more likely to identify with a victim than an adult? The concept of wrestling as an aesthetic performance is also interesting, particularly in the context of a discussion of gender roles. How can we reconcile the emotional responses of viewers of wrestling with the performance of masculinity that is being paraded? How might viewing such a display inform a child&#39;s, male or female, concept of masculinity?<br>
