Pryor starts with remarks about the police, perhaps because he had recently been arrested (for shooting his departing wife&#39;s car!), but also as part of a general diatribe against profiling -- one of the first public critiques of this practice on record. Then he launches into his rightly famous impromptu remarks about white audience members, caricaturing white guys racism and nerdy personalities, and lauding black men&#39;s cool,  daring, and sexual confidence.  The critique of white (a)sexuality is trenchant and witty.  The interaction with the audience is striking, as is the audience reaction (they are well miked so we can hear clearly the cadence of their rising and falling engagement, the depth and mounting hysteria of their laughter).<br><br>-JMB
