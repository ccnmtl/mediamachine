Pryor is famous for his way of relating with the animal world, as though his pets provided solace and affection in a way that human relationships could not.  His connection with the world of animals is perhaps somewhat touchy if you take into account the way in which white folks have tended to relegate African Americans and other minorities to the domain of beasts (of burden) -- as in Disney cartoons like &#34;Jungle Book&#34; and &#34;Aristocats.&#34;  His gestures and imagery in this segment are particularly pointed, as is the way he builds those into short, quasi- documentary narratives. The performance is so polished yet fresh, it isn&#39;t clear if it is heavily rehearsed or counter-intuitively improvised.  The bestial world is also at times the world of the phallus and the father.<br>-JMB
