The first and arguably the best of the Pryor concert films, of the 3 or 4 they turned out. This is often spoken of as one of the best stand-up performances on celluloid, by the comedian voted the first awardee in the Comedy Hall of Fame (Jonathan Winters was the second).  It is noted for its definitive impersonations of animals and honkies.  Pryor is hyped on coke here, but is so relaxed and brilliant, so much at the top of his form, so incisive and with such great timing, that it is almost an inadvertent ad for drugs!  Later movies deal with his subsequent, less fortunate experiences with freebasing.<br>-JMB
