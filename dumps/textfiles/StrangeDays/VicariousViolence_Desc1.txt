In the year 1999, VR (virtual reality) films are the drug of choice for many people, including Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes), a former cop who now both peddles and is addicted to them. VR films allow the user to insert a disc into a viewer and visually and sensationally sample the cerebral responses of the individual who made the recording.<br><br>Lenny has received several discs that depict the rape and murder of women, and as he &#34;researches&#34; this case, he samples some of these discs. In this scene, the killer enters the apartment and attacks a woman, placing the virtual reality viewer on her own eyes, so that she is simultaneously being raped and experiencing the rape through his perceptions. Meanwhile, Lenny, through the catharsis and voyeurism of the VR film, is experiencing both sensations. The boundaries between the perpetrator of violence, the victim of the violence and the bystander in this clip are blurred in this scenario; is this VR viewer analogous to an attitude, other technologies, or media?
