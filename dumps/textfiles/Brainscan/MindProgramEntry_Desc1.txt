By entering Brainscan, Michael (Edward Furlong) enters into an alternate reality where he is coaxed by the game to commit acts that he would never dream of committing in real life such as murdering a boy with whom he is in competition for his lovely next-door neighbor&#39;s affections. As the game&#39;s counter ticks away almost 60 minutes, Michael stealthily enters his nemesis&#39; home and brutally murders him. Although this act seems to last only a few minutes, when Michael returns to real time, almost 50 minutes have passed.<br><br>The voice guiding Michael through Brainscan is presumably generated by the game, or is it? Consider Michael&#39;s acting out in Brainscan as acting out an adolescent fantasy of killing those who oppress you in the social order of high school. In light of such events as Columbine and other films, could this voice be a part of Michael&#39;s own subconscious that is empowered by the virtual space of the game to act out his most brutal fantasies? Note that after Michael returns to real life, he is invigorated, gulping from a glass of milk like an animal or some savage man. How does his virtual adventure relate to our use of technology in our fantasy lives as we create alter egos, or specifically to the fantasy lives of teenagers? (jlh)<br>
