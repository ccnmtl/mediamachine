Michael (Edward Furlong) at last meets his alter ego in Brainscan, a video game that extends far beyond the parameters of the computer screen and into his actual life. In this scene Michael hovers over the bed of his next door neighbor, Kimberly (Amy Hargreaves) as Trickster (T. Ryder Smith), his alter ego in the game, encourages him to slash into her with the large knife he is brandishing. <br><br>Michael, a somewhat brooding, loner sort of teen, seems more afraid of Kimberly than he does of the bizarre and freakish Trickster. Trickster's entreating Michael to murderous ends and his amusement at Michael's attempts to fight him off give a sort of hopelessness to Michael, since he is not strong enough to resist being absorbed completely into the Trickster persona. Is it possible that at the end of the clip, Kimberly's pledge of love is based on the newfound confidence that Trickster/Michael possesses over the former awkward teenage Michael? (jlh)<br>
