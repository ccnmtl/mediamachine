In what is something of a climax to the movie, there is a terminal confrontation between the captain of the ship, Dave (Keir Dullea), and HAL, the monolithic computer that runs the ship.  HAL has malfunctioned, taking too much responsibility for the mission, even to the point of killing off one of the crew and refusing to take orders from Dave.  Dave decides that HAL must be disabled, and sets about the required disconnection.  HAL pleads for his life but, unsuccessful, he lapses into a reverie as the disconnection takes effect and his memory banks unravel, singing the British WW1 music hall standard &#34;Daisy,&#34; as though drunk.  The contrast between technical efficiency/control and sentimental pop song is both jarring and moving. (jmb)
