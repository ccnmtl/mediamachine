This ground-breaking epic, based on a novel by celebrated science fiction author Arthur C.Clarke, is centered on the appearance and reappearance of a mysterious high tech monolith (a &#34;sentinel&#34;) that looks peculiarly like a smaller version of the U.N. building. It is supposed to be a simple sign that there is intelligent extraterrestrial life. It crops up at various key junctures in historical time, first manifesting itself to an ape-like prehuman tribe. <br><br>By something more than a coincidence, this primal horde then discovers murder: one of its members conducts the first intra-species killing, clubbing a competitor to death. In a propadeutic montage, the savage beast tosses a thigh bone into the air, in celebration, and it is transformed into a space ship en route to a circular space station, 40,000 years later. <br><br>In turn, we segue from the logistics of transportation to the symbolic technology of literacy, as we see a pen that has slipped from the grasp of a sleeping traveller inside the ship, now floating deliriously in zero gravity.
