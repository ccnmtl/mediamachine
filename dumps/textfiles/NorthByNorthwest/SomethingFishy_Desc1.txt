This tour de force by the old British master follows Roger O.Thornhill (Cary Grant), the victim of a seriously mistaken identity ("George Kaplan"), as he tries to flee his mysterious and insistent pursuers.  <br>	The title of the movie is a reference to the "I can tell a hawk from a handsaw" speech in which Shakespeare has Hamlet analyzing his own supposed madness.<br><br>In this scene, on a train, the hero is rescued twice by an attractive stranger, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).  She acts as his guardian angel, first shoving him into the men's room, then (after a delightfully seductive girl-power lunch) going further and shoving him into her private compartment.<br>-JMB
