In this Disney twist on the traditional story, Belle lives with her father in a provincial French town. She is an intellectual and a beauty, to the bewilderment of her neighbors including her conceited suitor, Gaston. Belle must live with a Beast (a prince who was transformed by a spell) in order to free her father from his clutches, and the two learn that love involves more than mutual physical admiration. Listening to the song in this clip, one wonders if it isn&#39;t Gaston who is, in fact, a beast. (jlh)
