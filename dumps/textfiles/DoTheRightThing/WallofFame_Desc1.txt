Roger Ebert called this movie "a joyous slice of life," with its vivid depiction of a single, scorching day on the street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn.  This particular street is ethnically heterogeneous (African American, Puerto Rican, Asian American, Italian American).  <br><br>The various combinations in the mix are reduced to a not so joyous confrontation between African American residents and the owners of a pizza place.  The boss/father (Danny Aiello) refuses to allow photos of Malcolm X and MLK to be put up on the walls of his restaurant alongside those of Sinatra and Dean Martin.  The conflict escalates when he smashes the boombox of one insistent customer, Radio Rahim, with a baseball bat.  The homies (e.g., Giancarlo Esposito) are outraged, but things get even nastier when the police arrive and a chokehold on Radio Rahim ends up killing him. <br><br>A bit later, in retaliation, Mookie (Spike Lee himself), who works for the pizza place, nevertheless decides to "fight the power" by tossing a garbage can through the window of the parlor, and in the ensuing riot the place is burned down.  Later, Mookie and his boss are reconciled. <br><br>The poster caption for the movie reads "It's the hottest day of the summer. You can do nothing, you can do something, or you can ... Do the Right Thing," which seems to suggest a kind of ethical existentialism.  The opening music for the film is Public Enemy's "Fight the Power," suggesting a revolutionary attitude and perhaps an ethnic politics of identity. (jmb)<br><br>
