This lower case but impressive debut feature by a now famous, Oscar winning director explores the relation between love, and real or mediated sex.  <br>	A maverick character adrift in life, Graham (James Spader) moves back into town for unclear reasons, and looks up his old college buddy John (Peter Gallagher, of the luxuriant eyebrows).  He immediately strikes up an odd, self-disclosing friendship with John&#39;s neurotic wife, Ann (ex-model Andie Macdowell, whose sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo, of TV&#39;s `Just Shoot Me&#39;) is having a surreptitious, passionate affair with John.<br>	The plot centers on two complicated, psychologically conflicted people, a narcissistic man who seems to have lost his center and a woman who is unhappily married and generally at odds with the world, which we see through the eyes of her therapist.  Each of them could be said to mediate between two of the other characters.<br>	Graham is like a graduate student in film, working on a research project, but a rather perverse one.  He has substituted the shooting and watching of videotapes for real sex and relationships.  This approach shifts sexuality into discourse (Foucault&#39;s preoccupations) while focusing on the pleasure of the woman (Lacan&#39;s &#34;jouissance&#34;) -- both of which are then mediated by a process of permanent, photographic recording.<br>	Will John find out about the growing intimacy, and will Ann find out about her sister&#39;s perfidy?  Will the two women agree to be taped by Graham, discussing the details of their sex lives and even masturbating?  What does all this mediation mean?  Can representation itself be symbolic?
