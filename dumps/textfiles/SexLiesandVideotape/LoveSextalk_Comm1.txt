Ann (Andie MacDowell) and Graham (James Spader) have only met yesterday, and yet in this conversation, they share their thoughts on therapy, intimacy and sex. Ann, married to a man she does not love who is having an affair with her sister, is skeptical of the importance of sex in relationships, while Graham, who is impotent, is unable to have sex with a partner.<br><br>Graham, unable to have sex, proclaims that physical intimacy is necessary for people to truly disclose their secrects to one another, while Ann, seemingly most comfortable divulging information to strangers such as Graham and her therapist, disagrees. What do these positions say about their ideas of what intimacy involve? Are Graham and Ann being honest with themselves or do they use their dialogue with others to resonctruct the truth? How does gender play into their views? How does their access to sex combined with these other factors shape these perceptions? (jlh)
