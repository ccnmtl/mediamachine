The film &#34;The Basketball Diaries&#34; received more critical attention following the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, which were inspired in part by this scene, than it did during its original release in 1995. Carroll&#39;s life consisted of trials such as periodic beatings by his priest/teacher, the recent death of his best friend, attempts by his basketball coach to molest him and experimentation with drugs such as heroin, cocaine and pharmaceuticals in order to escape from it all. <br><br>In this clip we see Jim (Leonardo Di Caprio) in a bath after a run-in with his coach (Bruno Kirby). Jim has just shot up, and as his eyes roll back in his head, he begins to fantasize the violent shooting that has become so famous.<br><br>Jim, in his fantasy, has steeled himself against any pain, and as he kicks through a painting of Christ, he begins shooting. This moment is Jim&#39;s fantasy of power, of domination, of revenge. Just as drugs are an escape, so are the recesses of Jim&#39;s mind. This clip, while interesting in its own right, is particularly significant in light of recent school shootings. When teenagers (and adults) feel marginalized, victimized and slighted by the circumstances of their lives, violence is often a result. This violence might be acted out against oneself, as with the use of drugs, or against other people. However, rarely do we discuss the role of fantasy in dealing with such feelings. <br><br>This scene of the film was designed to explore a fantasy, and yet, presenting it on screen seems to many irresponsible, a bad example to teens who share Jim&#39;s feelings. How do we reconcile representations in art of violent acts that are symbolic with the literal interpretations that may result? What is happening in our culture when we cannot distinguish between what is real and what is imagined? Is it safe to fantasize about dangerous things when such a distinction seems to be absent? Is this a problem only for teens or do adults fall victim to the same misinterpretation of film, art and literature? When are we using violence in these contexts to represent something and when is it simply gratuitous? (jlh)<br><br>
