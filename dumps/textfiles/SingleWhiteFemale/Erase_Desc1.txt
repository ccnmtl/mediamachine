When Heddy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) answered Ally's (Bridget Fonda) ad for a single, white female roommate, she found in addition to a new domicile a person with whose identity was infinitely more desirable than her own. In an effort to both win her affections and to protect her new (and presumably only) friend, Heddy uses sophisticated on-line expertise to erase from her geeky/licentious boss 's computer system all of the work using Ally's fashion software application that he had extracted from her prior to the harassment incident. Note that the geek, at this time, is apparently in the middle of another workplace harassment, albeit with rather more cooperation on this occasion. (jmb)
