This movie is based on the John Lutz novel, "Single White Female Seeks Same."  Ally (Bridget Fonda) is an attractive, young, self-employed career woman, who moves to New York City and rather impulsively become engaged to the first man she meets, an engagement that is quickly broken off.  After the break-up, she advertises for a "single, white, female" roommate, and eventually takes on a scruffy, neurotic yet affectionate and computer literate young woman called Heddy (the versatile Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is in many ways the opposite of Ally.<br><br>Ally used to have a business partner who cheated her, so she left to start up her own business based on complex and ingenious fashion software.  She runs into difficulties on a consulting job for a geeky, dirty old man, and Heddy steps in to save her bacon.<br><br>Ally goes to meet a potential client in a restaurant.  She demonstrates the software to him, pitching its labor-saving qualities.  He turns out to be a manipulative, sexist, chiseling weasel, but Ally (on hard times) feels she has to take the job anyway.
