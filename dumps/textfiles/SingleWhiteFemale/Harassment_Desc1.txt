Roommates Ally (Bridget Fonda) and Heddy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) are untied in an effort to thwart Ally's geeky and perverted boss using Heddy's computer savvy to save her friend from trouble. But unfortunately, under this veneer of veneration and protectiveness, Heddy turns out to be first impersonating her roommate, and then psychotically murderous, apparently (obscurely) as an effect of guilt over responsibility for the death of her twin sister in childhood.  As she declines into madness, her homoerotic love for Ally the mirror image, sister-substitute turns into rageful destructiveness, directed against Ally and anyone connected with her.  The movie degenerates into the typical slasher movie cliches, with the predictable ending.<br><br>Although the consultation has been rather successful, the geeky pervert client sexually harasses Ally on the job -- so much so that it appears that this may have been his main intention in hiring her.  She appears to comply but has a surprise in store for him. (jmb)<br>
