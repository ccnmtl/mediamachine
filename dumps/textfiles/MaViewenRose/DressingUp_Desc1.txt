Boys will be boys and girls will be girls, but one child isn&#39;t so sure in this Belgian comedy drama. 7-year-old Ludovic (Georges DuFresne) is happy, healthy, and good-natured, but there&#39;s a bit of a problem - he has decided that he&#39;s a girl. While his parents Hanna (Michele Laroque) and Pierre (Jean-Philippe Ecoffey) try to understand, Ludovic stubbornly refuses to listen to reason from his parents, teachers, or schoolmates. His fondness for wearing girl&#39;s clothes and frequent pronouncements to strangers that he&#39;s going to be a woman when he grows up become increasingly worrying, and things come to a head when Ludovic declares that when he&#39;s older, he plans to marry Jerome (Julien Riviere), the boy next door. It hardly helps that Pierre&#39;s boss, Albert (Daniel Hanssens), is also Jerome&#39;s father, and that he&#39;s notoriously closed-minded about gender issues. Will Pierre keep his job? Will the stress spoil Pierre and Hanna&#39;s marriage? And will Ludovic find the right shade of lipstick? Ma Vie En Rose was the first feature for director and screenwriter Alain Berliner. - Mark Deming.<br><br>(Allmovie.com)
