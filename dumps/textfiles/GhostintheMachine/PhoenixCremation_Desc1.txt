In this dream sequence, Terry Munroe (Karen Allen) attends a funeral that for some reason also includes the cremation of the deceased. The charred body then flies at her, growling like a demon. This return from the dead, indeed almost from the flames of hell, is a frightening thought, particularly since the hell seems to be one that is man-made. How does this kind of technology mesh with spiritual beliefs about afterlife? How is a such a phoenix different from a traditional one? (jlh)
