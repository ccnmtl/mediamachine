Terry Munroe (Karen Allen) and her son Josh (Wil Horneff) led by Bram (Chris Mulkey) foolishly think that a large electromagnet will protect them from the wrath of the serial killer that stalks the mother and son through the energy sources in their town. In a sort of electronic seance, the three conjure the killer, thinking that they can harness or at least control his power. Meanwhile, The Address Book Killer has other plans for them. Strengthened by his travels through computer systems, microwave ovens and fuse boxes, he uses his strength to be reborn as an electronic menace.<br><br>Is the killer "real?"

Or, is he even more threatening because he is imbued with the tangible power available via his close connection with items as everyday as our hairdryers and blenders? (jlh)<br>
