<br>	Max&#39;s holiday is all too successful.  In a vastly changed state, he plucks up his courage and returns along the road to Mandalay, the vast ancestral seat (why that name, we wonder?).  There, the new wife discovers de Winter&#39;s dead wife, Rebecca, had held charismatic sway over a retinue of devoted servants, chief among which the butch head housekeeper, who swoons over even her dead mistress&#39;s name.  <br>	The new Mrs. de Winter struggles with great difficulty to establish herself in this household, where everyone is still captive of the past.  They all seem to think Max has been a naughty boy and done something terribly impulsive.  They doubt and question the authority of the new mistress of the house.  The mystery of Rebecca, and that strangely closed off part of the mansion, deepens and becomes increasingly threatening.  A second tragedy looms (a theme revisited later in Hitchcock&#39;s &#34;Vertigo&#34;). <br>	Hitchcock excelled at the creation of moody, suspenseful situations, in which tragic fate seems a powerful presence (cf. &#34;Suspicion&#34;).  He borrows here not only from the dark romantic themes of 30&#39;s cinema but also from European drama of the turn of the century and -- one suspects -- the dramatic tropes of Freudian psychoanalysis.  The Oedipal triangle is dominant in much of Hitchcock&#39;s work, especially in this middle period (for example, &#34;Notorious,&#34; &#34;The 39 Steps,&#34; and &#34;Spellbound&#34;).  We can see several versions of it in this movie: Max/secretary/dowager, Max/wife/ Rebecca, and Max/wife/housekeeper.  Insofar as we are taken with Olivier&#39;s brilliant, crystalline charm or Fontaine&#39;s luminous innocence and vulnerability, we too may be drawn into a triangular constellation.  Mulvey and others have argued that such relationships between audience and characters, and among the characters themselves, are central to movie-viewing and in some sense define the traditional cinematic experience itself (as contrasted with other media).<br>-JMB
