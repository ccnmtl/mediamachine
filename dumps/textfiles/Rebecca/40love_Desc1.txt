<br>In this superb adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#39;s book, a youthful woman (Joan Fontaine), whose name remains obscure, is serving as the secretary (gopher) for a travelling dowager.  The latter develops an interest in a recently widowered aristocrat, Maximilian de Winter (played by Laurence Olivier).  The discontent of our de Winter soon gives way to a friendly interest, not in courting the dowager herself but in giving tennis and dancing lessons to her young companion.  A romance rapidly (and compellingly) occurs, resulting in a precipitous marriage.  <br>	In this excerpt from the whirlwind romance, we see various elements of the conventional heterosexual relationship of the British late 30s: the May/September gap; the man as lofty provider (and how!); the woman as healer (of the injured soldier) and as victim herself; the man as (attempted) patriarchal dominator in both relationship and his domestic domain; the husband as caught up in the dread heritage of a maternal ghost (Freud, Ibsen); the masculine and its concealed, suppressed, tormented interiority as withdrawing from intimacy and yet driving the plot.  <br><br>-JMB
