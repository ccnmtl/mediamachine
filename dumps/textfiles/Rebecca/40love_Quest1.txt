<br>*  How does gender hierarchy manifest itself in this segment?  How does it function as a plot device (constructing situations and their eventuations) and as a diegetic device (unpacking characters&#39; history and psychology and their implications)?<br><br>* What is the woman&#39;s part in such an asymmetrical relationship? What needs does she have and how are they expressed?<br><br>* How is the dowager&#39;s failed attempt to attract de Winter used to foreshadow?  <br><br>* Does he in some way violate a norm, etiquette, or even her personage?  What does it mean that he breaks the close working relationship between an older and younger woman?<br><br>* What symbolic forms does death appear in, in these scenes?<br><br>* From whose point of view is the story told?<br><br>* The woman seems sketchy, halting, flinching, censoring herself, blurting out.  How does this signify youth, and in relation to what, then? <br><br>* How may it prefigure the abuses to come? How is violence adumbrated in these scenes of &#34;falling&#34; in love?<br><br>* How does a woman fall in love? What about that may make it a dangerous experience, and why would she be willing to face that danger?<br><br>* Why do the couple marry so quickly?<br><br>* What does the tennis racquet (not balls) signify? <br><br>* Why the dwelling on bags and baggage?<br><br>* What dramatic potential does the director (writer) find in the so-called stability of a traditional male-dominant relationship?<br><br>* Note that Max has a &#34;de&#34; in front of his surname, much as du Maurier had herself. What is the significance of this sign of French nobility?  <br><br>* How else are names used in this story?  How is &#34;de Winter&#34; as &#34;the name of the Father&#34; used?  Why &#34;winter&#34;?<br><br>* More generally, how is social class portrayed and used in the movie, and how does it contribute to the plot?<br><br>* There are at least three images of the mother introduced at the start of the film -- as many as there are female characters. One lady has vanished and remains the most suppressed maternal presence of the three.  How do the director/author play with these fragments and why so many of them -- wouldn&#39;t one have been enough?<br><br>* Place, motion, passage, and &#34;transport&#34; are central to most du Maurier stories. How are they important here?  Daphne lived on a bluff above a beautiful estuary in Devon, southwest England.  How might this scenic, coastal location have affected or reflected her relation to geographical space?<br><br>* For further research, connect the heroine or her relationship in this story to her situation in other du Maurier classics: Frenchman&#39;s Creek, Jamaica Inn, The Birds, the Lord Peter Whimsey novels. What is the tragic dimension to love for du Maurier?<br><br><br>-JMB
