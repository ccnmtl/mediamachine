Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), two lovers star-crossed along the lines of class at the turn of the 20th century find themselves aboard the most famous sinking ship of all time. As the two attempt to foil the inevitable, they race against obstacles such as Rose's cuckholded finace, a shortage of lifeboats and, in this clip, gravity. As the ship sinks, they rush for the highest ground they can find: a tall spire at the bow of the ship. The Titanic, broken into two pieces, one standing erect in the ocean, slowly sinks into the sea.<br><br>1997<br>
