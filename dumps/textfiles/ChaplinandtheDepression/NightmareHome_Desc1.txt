He follows the gamin to a run-down, dilapidated lakeside shack where he gives the home a name: "It's Paradise." The ramshackle cabin provides a few visual gags - a beam falls on the Tramp's head when he shuts the door behind him, and a table collapses when he leans on it. Propping up sagging roof beams, the gamin says: "Of course it's no Buckingham Palace." He falls into the lake behind the shack when he leans on the back door. He sleeps outside in the doghouse for the night and the next morning attempts swimming, diving head first into two feet of water. There, they set up a home. As his relationship evolves with the resilient, homeless gamin, he establishes a friendly, protective and loving relationship with her.
