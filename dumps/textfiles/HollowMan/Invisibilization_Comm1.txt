In this moralistic tale, worthy of H.G.Wells, Dr.Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant, narcissistic egomaniac, with a salacious sense of humor.  He heads a team of bright and nice, but subordinate, medical scientists, including his unrequiting enamorata (Kim Dickens or Mary Randle?), his conflicted ex-girlfriend (Elizabeth Shue), and her current beau (Josh Brolin).  	This group has been experimenting for years on a Defence Department project with ambiguous military applications.  The top secret project is concerned with the transformation of mammals such as apes to an invisible condition and then returning them to their original bodily state (the so-called &#34;reversion&#34;). <br>	Sebastian impatiently jumps the project forward prematurely to experimentation on humans by volunteering himself as the guinea pig.  Despite difficulties at first, the process is entirely successful.  Once out of the reach of the unaided eye, naked and unashamed, he feels free to perform the unthinkable -- sex, violence and sometimes both.  When the research team is unable to bring him back, however, he turns even nastier.<br>
