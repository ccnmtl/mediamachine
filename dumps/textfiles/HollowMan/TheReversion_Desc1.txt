A team of scientists researching the possibility of making beings invisible brings a gorilla named Isabel back to visibility in this clip. As she returns, she not only endures terrible physical pain, but also seems to suffer from mental anguish as well, including panic and fear. <br><br>As the team of doctors revives the gorilla, each one embodies a certain trait of the human psyche. Linda (Elisabeth Shue) the ego, Sebastian (Kevin Bacon) is the id and Matthew (Josh Brolin) is the superego. Together, this team seems to function. However, it is apparent that if one element of consciousness takes control, there will be trouble. <br><br>The pleasure at the end of the scene almost seems sinister. The ability to control this process, indeed to remove and then rebirth an organism from our world is certainly an activity with interesting consequences and responsibilities. How might this notion fit into a psychoanalytic framework? (jlh)<br>
