Francoise, Etienne, and Richard set out for a bohemian backpacker&#39;s paradise. Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), the leader of the group and the only American is given a map by his next door neighbor at a backpacker&#39;s hostel. He befriends the French couple and as the three travel together, Richard becomes enamored with Francoise. <br><br>In this clip, Etienne&#39;s sighting of a fin and the reactions of Francoise and Richard to it are all somewhat indicative of their characters. Just as Etienne does not argue with Richard, who ultimately decides to swim for it, he does not accept the responsibility of seeing the fin. Worse, if Francoise disappears, the two of them are stuck together on this adventure, an end neither of them seems to want. (jlh)<br>
