&#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; is arguably one of the great post modern American films of the 90s, as Blue Velvet was for the 80s.  It is a bizarre, sometimes surreal, &#34;ultra-violent,&#34; non-sequential movie made up of three different, equally grotesque stories.<br><br>This scene, part of the &#34;second&#34; tale, is adapted from Dashiell Hammett&#39;s short story `My Brother&#39;s Keeper.&#39;  A semi-professional boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis), is about to run off on his hog with Fabian, his girlfriend, after he has made a lot of illicit money by refusing to throw a fight for his gangster boss (compare the fated Marion Crane in &#34;Psycho,&#34; who has stolen $40k from her boss).  <br><br>However, in the preparations for flight, Fabian left behind  his Dad&#39;s watch on the nightstand.  That&#39;s a problem, since this timepiece is the only momento left from Butch&#39;s Dad, who was imprisoned in a POW camp during the war but was able to hide the watch in his rectum (compare Johnny Depp in &#34;Before Night Falls&#34;), whence it finally ended up with Butch&#39;s uncle (Christopher Walken -- see the great scene earlier when he &#34;passes&#34; the watch on to a grief-stricken 7 year-old Butch). <br><br>Butch must return to his apartment to get the heirloom, but this is a dire prospect, since his apartment is likely to be staked out by his boss&#39;s hitmen.  When he arrives, however, the apartment seems to be empty, and he is able to pick up the watch and even have a little lunch before heading out.  It all seems so elementary.  <br><br>But there is a surprise in store, arranged along the preoedipal armature of kitchen (oral) to bathroom (anal), recapping Butch&#39;s early development and the rectitude of his father&#39;s sacrifice, as well as the fratricidal substructure of the fight game itself.  <br><br>Somewhere along the line, Modesty Blaise manages to get into the narrative, as well as Deleuze & Guattari&#39;s famous &#34;red stain on a white wall,&#34; reminiscent of other bathroom scenes from &#34;Psycho&#34; and &#34;Last Tango in Paris,&#34; to &#34;Psycho 3,&#34; &#34;Twelve Monkeys,&#34; and &#34;What Lies Beneath.&#34;  The events that unfold could be viewed as a disquisition on Deleuze&#39;s notion of the philosophical significance of contingency, which undermines our usual conceptual and moral assumptions about intentional action (cf. Steve Shaviro&#39;s excellent book, `The Cinematic Body.&#39;)
