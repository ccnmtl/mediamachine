&#34;In every generation there is a Chosen One, she alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of evil. She is the Slayer.&#34; So begins Joss Whedon&#39;s television series. 
Events take place in Sunnydale, a small town built atop a &#34;hellmouth,&#34; a portal &#34;between this reality and the next.&#34; The spectators&#39; willing suspension of disbelief begins with the acceptance that Sunnydale stands &#34;at a mystical convergence between earth and its total destruction.&#34; Buffy is the slayer and a 10th grade girl.<br><br>This episode, the third from the first season, is called `Witch,&#39;  (written by someone called Ruston).  It is concerned with a contrast of the relationships between two sets of mothers and daughters. Buffy tries out for the cheerleading squad. &#34;I will still have time to fight the forces of evil. OK? I just want to have a life. I want to do something normal, something safe.&#34; At the tryouts she meets Amy whose mother, a witch, has changed bodies with her teenage daughter, in an effort to relive the glory of her cheerleading past. &#34;She said I was wasting my youth, so she took it from me.&#34; This bad mother proceeds to cast spells on girls: sets the hands of one on fire, blinds another, and removes the mouth of another (cf. Neo in &#34;The Matrix&#34;). When Amy talks of practicing cheers with her mother for three hours day, Buffy responds, &#34;That much quality time with my mom would probably lead to some quality matricide.&#34; Buffy saves the day, annihilates the bad mother, has a good talk with her good mother (who has been too distracted with her own life to appropriate her daughter&#39;s), and decides cheerleading is too dangerous for her.<br>-Alison Matika
