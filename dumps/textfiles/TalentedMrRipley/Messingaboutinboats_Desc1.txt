Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) has a peculiar affection for Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law). While there is obviously some romantic attraction on Tom&#39;s part, as evidenced by his jealousy of Dickie&#39;s marriage plans and his carousing with women in general, Tom&#39;s envy of Dickie&#39;s charm and joie de vivre cause him to vascillate between wanting to sleep with Dickie and wanting to be him.  In this scene, as he murders his best friend, the stage is set for Tom to assume Dickie&#39;s identity. <br><br>As the two fight verbally and physically, as a viewer, it is difficult to find one of these characters more pallatable than the other. If  they are indeed two parts of the same whole, what sort of identity has each splintered into? Are they in fact so different at all? (jlh)<br><br>
