Jeff Daniels portrays Charles Briggs, a forlorn businessman whose daily dose of excitement includes such acts of law-bending as &#34;dine and dash&#34; and the occasional petty shoplifting spree. Lulu (Melanie Griffith) catches a glimpse of this spark of civil disobedience and decides to take him on a tour of her own bizarre life, including such pit stops as her mother&#39;s house and her high school reunion where the two encounter her psychotic ex-husband. In this clip, Lulu challenges Charles to join her in her escapades. Although it is obvious that she makes him extremely nervous, he is still excited by her eclectic image. All is not as it seems, and as the two head out of the city through the Holland Tunnel, both of their constructed self-images prepare to unravel. (jlh)<br><br>
