Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) has a fear of flying and he must travel by plane to his wedding. Before the plane takes off, a bird is shredded in the propeller causing the plane to crash before it ever leaves the ground. Meanwhile, Ben has met Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock), a woman who serves as the ideal foil to his own cautious and careful manner.<br><br>In addition to flying, we learn through this clip that Ben also fears his impending marriage. While his bride-to-be unwraps assorted hideous wedding gifts, Ben is struggling to write sincere wedding vows on an airplane. When Sarah arrives, she seems to instantly upset the delicate balance that Ben has maintained until that moment. <br><br>It is interesting to note that the man next to Ben on the flight is rather piggish, which perhaps makes Ben seem to be a better man than he is. What is the significance of these three characters' interchange on the flight? Is a statement being made here about what marriage signifies in light of a man's masculinity or machismo? The varying perception of men and women regarding marriage also seem to be addressed here. What might Ben's fear of flying represent in terms of his relationships with women? (jlh)<br>
