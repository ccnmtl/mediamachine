The film "Eraserhead" tells the tragic tale of Henry (Jack Nance), an unemployed, zombie-like misfit who claims to have been a printer in a factory.  His spastic girlfriend comes from a psychotic family whose dilapidated apartment is buried deep in the industrial landscape. The plot, suffused with extreme angst, centers on the premature birth, early rearing, and eventual euthanasia of their deformed baby. All this within a mystical, cosmic framework, as obscure as it is cinematically inventive.<br><br>Henry is depicted sideways or horizontally aligned almost astrologically with a rough-hewn planet, perhaps the Moon. In some remote, decontextualized room, there is a mysterious and ponderous man, whose complexion resembles the pocked and pallid surface of that heavily symbolic satellite. He is pulling on levers like some desultory railway signal-man. Henry appears to be vaguely aware of this other-worldly presence or its influence, and haunted by it. <br>It is unclear whether or not this is some fantasy of Henry's, but it appears to interrupt his progress through the bombed-out landscape only temporarily.
