This grotesque, brooding, deliberately labored experimental film in the surreal, kitchen-sink genre, was made by Lynch in film school, and has since become a cult favorite.  It is set in a dark, post-apocalyptic landscape of mechanization, decay, pollution, and depressing poverty, reminiscent of Soviet East Berlin, which gives the adjective "nightmarish" an entirely new meaning. <br><br>Lynch's preoccupation with underworlds and low-life and his grim black humor, are revisited in his "Blue Velvet," "Wild at Heart," "Twin Peaks," and "Mulholland Drive." The formal and visual qualities of these movies are detectable in the movies of other young directors, especially Vincent Gallo in "Buffalo 66."<br><br>Henry (Jack Nance), nervous at the best of times, has been invited to an anxiety-provoking evening meal at the rodent-infested flat of his girlfriend's parents. While the mummified grandma smokes quietly in the kitchen, father passes the knife to Henry, citing nauseatingly a strange arm-paralysis/self-mutilation story.  This turns out to be paralleled disturbingly by the bizarre animation and liquid excretion of the man-made chicken Dad has served for this special dinner. <br><br>Mother has a bad reaction, for reasons that only later become apparent, when we discover the "shotgun" scenario behind this dinner: the ululating mom returns to inform Henry of the baby's secret, early birth and threatens Henry with dire consequences if he does not marry her daughter promptly.
