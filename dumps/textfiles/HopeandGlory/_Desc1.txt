A semiautobiographical project by John Boorman about a nine year old boy called Bill as he grows up in London during the blitz of World War II. For a young boy, this time in history was more of an adventure, a total upheaval of order, restrictions and discipline. This film explores the liberating effect of the war on the women left behind and the joy when Hitler blows up your school. (imdb) <br><br>
