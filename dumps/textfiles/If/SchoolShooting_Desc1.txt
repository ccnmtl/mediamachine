Malcolm McDowells&#39; debut as an archetypal disgruntled, disturbed, acting out youth anti-hero, a role he reprises in Clockwork Orange and mainstreamed in Oh Lucky Man and Britannia Hospital (both directed by Lindsay Anderson).<br><br>This scene is the final one, combining the punctate terminality of sudden death with the punctual finality of the end of school. It depicts how McDowell and his anti-authoritarian cohorts reach their limit and express in an unlimited manner their feeling of being finished with school -- &#34;School&#39;s out for ever&#34; in the words of Alice Cooper. <br><br>The suddenness of shocking, fatal assault contrasts with the &#34;gradual&#34; transition from school to the rest of life. The end of school becomes a graduation from life itself. (jmb)<br><br>
