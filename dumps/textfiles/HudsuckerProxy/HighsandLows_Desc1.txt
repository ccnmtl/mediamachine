
Joel Coen and Ethan Coen concocted this stylish screwball comedic amalgam of Frank Capra and Howard Hawks. Tim Robbins stars as Norville Barnes, a dull-wit from Muncie, Indiana who wrangles a job with the big Hudsucker Industries. He has a singular idea for a new children&#39;s toy that he wants to present to corporate executive Sidney J. Mussberger (Paul Newman). As he makes his way up to Mussberger&#39;s office, the company president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) is on his way down - through the window of the forty-fourth floor boardroom! Hudsucker&#39;s death sets off a panic that Mussberger sees as an opportunity for taking over the company - by installing a total incompetent in Hudsucker&#39;s place and devaluing the stock. When Barnes stumbles into Mussberger&#39;s office, Mussberger sees his pigeon and appoints Barnes as the new company president. The only problem is that the new product Barnes proposes for the company, the Hula Hoop, turns out to be a tremendous success, and Mussberger has difficulty manipulating his new corporate president. - Paul Brenner (allmovie.com)
