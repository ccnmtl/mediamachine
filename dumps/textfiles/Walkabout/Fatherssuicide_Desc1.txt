Two children are abandoned by their father, who commits suicide during a journey with them across the Australian outback. The girl (Jenny Agutter) has assumed the role of mother, as she listens closely to radio programs about table manners and prepares a picnic lunch. Her young brother (Luc Roeg), meanwhile shoots his water pistol at passing planes, his toys and even at his father, who responds by shooting live ammunition back at his children. The little boy does not seem to register that this is not, in fact, a game and that his father&#39;s bullets, unlike his water stream, are lethal. (jlh)
