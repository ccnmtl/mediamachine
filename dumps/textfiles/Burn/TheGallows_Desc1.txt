"Burn" was called a "superb epic" and rated "one of the great films of the 60s" by Z Magazine.  This gorgeously photographed movie, one of the few major feature films about the end of the colonial era, starts with a depiction of how Portuguese sugar plantations made a tropical island paradise into an oppressive nightmare.  Marlon Brando plays William Walker, an English gentleman both alliterative and equestrian, who arrives by sea appearing to be an intelligence expert intent on helping the slaves mount an effective rebellion.<br><br>However, in fact he turns out to have been sent by his government, to incite surreptitiously an insurrection that will allow the British to take over and resubjugate the population. He trickily schools the leaders of the resistance into an uprising that cripples the Portuguese but actually misses the boat. Betraying the noble slaves with whom he had formed an alliance, he uses the revolt he has helped design to make the rebels seem dangerously uncivilized, which in turn he uses to justify their being put down by the British military.  <br><br>His revolting deed is done. In the background looms the eery silhouette of the gallows he has helped erect to hang the insubordinate natives. He heads for the harbor to take the ship home again, no longer on horseback. But he ends up making a more radical departure than he'd intended. While he is walking toward the boat, one of the "burned", in disguise, manages to slip through and discreetly stab him to death.  Walker's life ends not in homecoming glory but in humiliating squalor, in the dire foreign land he has so treacherously bought and sold. (jmb)<br><br>
