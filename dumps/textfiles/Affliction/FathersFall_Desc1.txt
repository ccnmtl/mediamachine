This clip begins with Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) lying on the ground, defeated by the grim circumstances of his life. His girlfriend has just left him and taken with her his daughter, who begs to be taken home to her mother, Wade&#39;s estranged wife. Wade and his brother Rolfe, who remains omniscient through most of the film, save the last scene (Willem Dafoe), were brought up in a household terrorized by their father&#39;s rage and alcoholism. Wade is the sheriff of their small New Hampshire town and he has recently come unglued due to an investigation into a hunting accident, a malicious toothache and his recent decision to live with his father again after his mother passes away. In this clip we see Wade&#39;s father congratulating him on the fact that he, too, has managed to chase everyone out of his life. In this intensely Oedipal scene, Wade acts out what Rolfe refers to as, &#34;the affliction of that man&#39;s [their father] anger.&#34; (jlh)
