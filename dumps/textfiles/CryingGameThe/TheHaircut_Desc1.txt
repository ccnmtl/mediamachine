Note to the Viewer: This abstract contains information that may spoil this film for you. You may want to watch the movie before looking at this clip.<br><br>This film foregrounds issues of gender, yet involves many violent subtexts. Fergus (Stephen Rea) is an IRA soldier who, for a time, was responsible for a British prisoner, Jody (Forrest Whittaker). During Jody&#39;s captivity, he gives Fergus a photograph of his girlfriend back home, Dil. After Jody&#39;s death, for which Fergus is ultimately responsible, he finds Dil working in a hair salon and impulsively decided to get his hair cut. The two immediately develop a connection, and the film follows the revelations that they make in discovering each others&#39; perceptions regarding gender and their own.<br><br>In this scene, it is Fergus&#39; turn to cut Dil&#39;s hair, only this time the haircut is eroticized. Fergus has learned that Dil is a transsexual, yet he is still attracted to her. In this intimate scene, Fergus first cuts Dil&#39;s long hair into a short, asexual style, removes her women&#39;s clothing and begins to dress her in leisurely men&#39;s tennis attire. <br><br>Is Fergus&#39;s wish here to be with another man? Does the fact that Dil perceives herself as a woman make this act less taboo or moreso? What sort of gender roles are being played out in this clip? (jlh)<br>
