Thelma and Louise trick a truck driver who has been harassing them on the highway into pulling off the road to confront him. They ask him precisely what he expects to be the outcome of his advances, wondering how he might react to such advances made by other men to his mother or wife. When he refuses to apologize, the two women shoot at his large silver tanker, with its tumescent cargo of oil, causing it to explode. <br><br>In this clip, note the use the hubcap as mirror, his shiny silver tanker and his glasses are interesting to note, as is the use of the gun against the tanker. Thelma swipes the trucker's hat, blown from his head, from the ground as a trophy and places it on her own head as the two speed away. <br><br>How do the women take up their roles as teachers, and how is this related to the lesson they teach the policeman in "Pulled Over?" How would you describe the kind of pedagogy they employ?
