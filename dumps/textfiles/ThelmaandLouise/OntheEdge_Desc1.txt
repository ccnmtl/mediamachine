Cornered between the law and the edge of a cliff, Thelma and Louise decide to drive off the edge and into the canyon to avoid capture. The sympathetic agent assigned to their case (Harvey Keitel) runs toward them, trying to communicate that he knows about the prior assault on Louise (a supposedly mitigating circumstance to commute her crime). As he chases them, a Polaroid photo of the two women at the outset of their adventure, looking prim in scarves and sunglasses, flies up from the backseat. The scene ends with their green car suspended over the huge gulf.<br><br>What is the symbolic meaning of their position "on the edge"? Why are there so many police officers arrayed against them? What is the significance of the one good lieutenant who tries to negotiate with them? Why do they reject his solicitations? How is this connected with their previous relationships with men? <br><br>What is the meaning of the final kiss (improvised by Geena Davis)? What is the significance of their double suicide-is it a classic liebestod? (See Fiedler, "Life and Death in the American Novel.") Why the Grand Canyon? (c.f. "Grand Canyon" and "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.")
