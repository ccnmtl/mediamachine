A weekend getaway turns into a getaway plan for two friends, Thelma (Geena Davis)  and Louise (Susan Sarandon) fleeing unsatisfactory relationships with men. Here they are on a run toward Mexico to beat murder charges against them for killing a man who tried to rape Thelma. Louise had been the victim of sexual assault earlier in her life, a fact that is intimated throughout the film and a trauma from which she has never fully recovered. As they travel through the Southwest, they segue from outlaws to vigilantes, shucking the constraints of the law and traditional gender roles. <br><br>In this scene, the two are pulled over for speeding by a police officer whom presents the biggest obstacle thus far between themselves and freedom, as he reflects their guilty faces in his mirrored shades. Notice their relation to guns, their appropriation of beverages and eyewear, their politeness and their attempt to educate the officer with a crash course in women&#39;s rights. Note also the emerging division of labor between the two women: who is teaching what to whom and who is learning? What do we learn about the relationship between gender and aggression in this excerpt?
