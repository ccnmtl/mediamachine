The historically important French painter Leger, famous for his chunky tubularity, made only one significant film.  It is part time and motion study, part extended metaphor.  He weaves images of geometric shapes, the patterns and rhythms of dramatically lit industrial machinery, and human movement into a rich tapestry.  The product seems sometimes profoundly symbolic and sometimes purely formal -- an exercise in complex structure, adding a fourth dimension to his artwork.<br>-JB
