Dawn Weiner (Heather Matarazzo) the archetypal junior high school nerd trapped in a developing female body. In this scene we observe the Weiner family at dinner, a painfully familiar vignette of American middle class life so presented on television. However, in this scene, the triad of conflict that emerges includes Dawn, her mother (Angela Pietropinto) and her angelic little sister, Missy (Daria Kalinina). It is clear that Dawn wishes harm toward her sister, but is it Missy's saccharine nature that provokes Dawn's homicidal tendencies or jealously for the affection of their mother, Marj? What does Marj's mediation indicate about her role in the conflict between her daughters? What are possible meanings behind Dawn's sawing the head off of Missy's pink-haired doll? <br><br>At the end of this clip, faint music can be heard, which is the music of the garage band alluded to at the beginning of the clip by Dawn's intensely geeky brother, Mark (Matthew Faber). Dawn sets down her project, distracted. What might these indicate about the conflicts of childhood and those of puberty and their interplay? (jlh)<br>
