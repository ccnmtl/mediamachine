While watching this clip, consider the development of masculinity. Dawn's best friend, Ralphie, is a boy tormented with nicknames such as "faggot," while his main oppressor, and Dawn's, is the local pariah, a boy named Brandon (Brendan Sexton III). Brandon is never without a small posse of toughs and his language is littered with cursing and threats, most of which have to do with violence. <br><br>After Dawn tells Brandon off, he threatens to rape her after school. What does Dawn's reaction to this prospect tell us about what exactly rape signifies in her mind, or what she imagines it means to Brandon? Dawn seems jealous when another girl flirts with Brandon as he watches her from a corner of the library. What do these sentiments tell us about sex, violence and identity formation? (jlh)<br>
