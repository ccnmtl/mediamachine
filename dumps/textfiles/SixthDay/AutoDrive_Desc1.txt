In &#34;The Sixth Day,&#34; Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Adam Gibson, a devoted father, husband and helicopter pilot who is chartered to fly the head of Replacement Technologies, the premier cloning company of the &#34;not-so-distant-future.&#34; In this clip, the trappings of upper-middle class life seem to be intact, from the driving of SUV&#39;s and the fashion sensibilities of the characters to their jocular dialogue about relationships, birthday parties and work commitments. <br><br>However, the relationship of the characters to their machines has changed: Hank Morgan (Michael Rappaport) jokes about his escapades with virtual girlfriends as he absent-mindedly lets Onstar drive his vehicle for him. Adam Gibson, played by the ever-earnest Schwarzennegger, seems to be battling these changing mores as he advocates for traditional relationships with human women, family values and keeping your hands on the wheel while driving.
