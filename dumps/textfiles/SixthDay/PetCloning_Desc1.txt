In this clip, Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzennegger) and is wife argue about the ethics of cloning their family pet to spare their daughter the anguish of dealing with its death. Gibson protests but his wife, who insists that since it is his birthday the dog&#39;s death is particularly untimely, hangs up on him before he can refuse. <br><br>The ability to clone a pet, or any mechanism, technological or otherwise, that allows us to curtail dealing with the end of life is at issue here. However, the fact that it is Gibson&#39;s own birthday suggests that it is more the notion of our feelings about life and death with regard to social mores that are in question here. Gibson&#39;s refusal to clone the pet on moral grounds is vetoed by his wife&#39;s desire to smooth over a difficult situation, invoking also stereotypes of gender. (jlh)<br>
