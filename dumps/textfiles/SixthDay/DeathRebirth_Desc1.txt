Mirror, mirror on the wall, are things as they truly appear to be? On his birthday, helicopter pilot Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) examines himself in the mirror, searching for signs of age, and almost seems disappointed at finding none. In this film, the veneer of an average middle-class existence shrouds Gibson&#39;s awareness of the subtle changes taking place everywhere, from the mysterious process of his own aging to the cloning of his favorite sports personality. Here, some irony is detectable, for as Gibson attempts to find symbols of his position in his life cycle, another man has been resurrected from the dead, skirting the paradigm altogether. (jlh)
