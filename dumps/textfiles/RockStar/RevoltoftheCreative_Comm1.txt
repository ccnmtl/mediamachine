A rock movie in the great tradition of &#34;The Doors,&#34; but with the bio-pic sensibility of the &#34;Buddy Holly Story,&#34; a sharp sense of the ersatz, and a leaning toward the romantic tragedy called fame as in &#34;A Star is Born,&#34; if not &#34;Velvet Goldmine.&#34;<br>    Chris Cole (Marky Mark -- of Planet of the Apes, Three Kings, and especially Boogie Nights) runs a small-time tribute band imitating the heavy metal honchos, &#34;Steel Dragon&#34; (Judas Priest), who are wildly reminiscent of &#34;Stillwater&#34; in &#34;Almost Famous.&#34;  He hits the big time when, junked by his own group for being too slavishly mimetic, he gets the telephone call from Steel Dragon themselves, asking him to fill in for a departing band member. He hits the big time and becomes a rock star, with much partying, hooking up, and consequent break-up with girlfriend/manager.  Jabs at cock rock, sexism, drugs, orgies, groupies,and the &#34;wives,&#34; but more Spinal Tap than the rather poignant &#34;Almost Famous.&#34;  Tepid Aniston as retreating sadsack girlfriend, but strong supporting acts throughout, especially the Steel Dragon road manager, who lends eternal significance to &#34;I gotta take a piss.&#34;<br><br>-JMB
