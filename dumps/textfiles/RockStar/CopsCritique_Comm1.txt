A rock movie in the great tradition of "The Doors," but with the bio-pic sensibility of the "Buddy Holly Story," a sharp sense of the ersatz, and a leaning toward the romantic tragedy called fame as in "A Star is Born," if not "Velvet Goldmine."<br>    Chris Cole (Marky Mark -- of Planet of the Apes, Three Kings, and especially Boogie Nights) runs a small-time tribute band imitating the heavy metal honchos, "Steel Dragon" (Judas Priest), who are wildly reminiscent of "Stillwater" in "Almost Famous."  He hits the big time when, junked by his own group for being too slavishly mimetic, he gets the telephone call from Steel Dragon themselves, asking him to fill in for a departing band member. He hits the big time and becomes a rock star, with much partying, hooking up, and consequent break-up with girlfriend/manager.  Jabs at cock rock, sexism, drugs, orgies, groupies,and the "wives," but more Spinal Tap than the rather poignant "Almost Famous."  Tepid Aniston as retreating sadsack girlfriend, but strong supporting acts throughout, especially the Steel Dragon road manager, who lends eternal significance to "I gotta take a piss."<br><br>-JMB
