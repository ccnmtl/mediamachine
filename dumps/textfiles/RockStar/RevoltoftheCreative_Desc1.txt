During the preparations of the tribute band for a performance, the manager (Chris&#39;s girlfriend, Emily) takes a hard look at the lead guitarist&#39;s crotch and insists on the &#34;no underwear&#34; policy that he is violating (cf. the &#34;Walk off&#34; segment from &#34;Zoolander&#34;).

After the show, Chris goes back to the practice room and finds that a coup has been staged, with the recalcitrant guitarist in the driver&#39;s seat.<br><br>-JMB
