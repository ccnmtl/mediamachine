Oliver and Oswald Deuce, twin brothers (Eric and Brian Deacon), lose their wives in a strange car crash caused by a female swan and a woman named Alba Bewick (Andrea Ferreol), who loses a leg. After the crash, the twins, who are both zoologists, become obsessed with death and proceed to study the decay of body parts of animals in the zoo.<br><br>In this clip, we see the brothers at work, recording the movements of the animals as they pace back and forth in captivity juxtaposed with remembrance of the fatal car crash.
