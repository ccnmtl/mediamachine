Selma, the heroine (Bjork), is a factory worker who engages in amateur dramatics as a hobby. Her failing eyesight makes this physical engagement with machines difficult and dangerous, much to the chagrine of her best friend (Catherine Deneuve). Selma manages to escape the humdrum of production line labor via her fantasies of being the star in a musical. In these daydreams, she sings and dances beautifully, and recruits all of her fellow workers into the song-and-dance numbers. The casting of Deneuve serves to emphasize the debt this movie owes to the 50s &#34;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&#34; (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg).
