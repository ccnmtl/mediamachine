Selma (Bjork) is a Czech woman who emigrates to the United States in the early 1960&#39;s with her young son. She works at a factory and lives an ascetic life in order to save money for a surgery that her son needs in order to stop the degeneration of his eyesight, a fate that she herself also suffers. Selma&#39;s passion is musical theatre and in her mind, she retreats to a world of Hollywood-style song and dance to fill her head with images that her sight cannot provide. As her eyesight worsens, she delves further into her fantasy life, which is often triggered by the sounds of machines. In this clip, the motion of the train provides the rhythm for Selma&#39;s reverie as she is confronted by a suitor about her inevitable blindness. (jlh)
