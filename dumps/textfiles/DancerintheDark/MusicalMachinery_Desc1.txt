Selma (Bjork) is losing her sight, and as she does, she retreats further into a fantasy life that mirrors the Hollywood style musicals of her dreams. The repetitive sounds of the machinery in the factory where Selma works provide the beat for a musical in her head that features the ensemble cast of her co-workers. As the machines play music, Selma entices her friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) to dance with her. In her dreams, Selma teaches Kathy to embrace a carefree life of dancing and singing, but in reality, it is Kathy who cares for Selma, looking out for her and attempting to help her face the reality of her condition.
