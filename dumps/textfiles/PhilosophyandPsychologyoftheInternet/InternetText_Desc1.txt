INTERNET TEXT is a meditation on the philosophy, psychology, political economy, and psychoanalytics of Internet (computer) communication. It focuses on virtual subjectivity, sexuality, community, and all aspects of computer interfacing. Please consult the Index for the list of topics.<P><P>The text consists of hundreds of sections written over a period of ten years, a continuous meditation on cyberspace, emphasizing issues of interiority, subjectivity, body, and language. The extended range of topics includes Net applications, as well as occasional reference to the underlying architecture and protocols of telecommunications; this is the materialist &#34;gristle&#34; that can&#39;t be discarded in analysis.</P><P></P><P>All of the sections have been presented on the Wryting and Cybermind email-lists, which I co-moderate.</P><P></P><P>The subject matter is in the form of &#34;short-waves, long-waves.&#34; The former are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles. These texts are completely interrelated; on occasion &#34;characters&#34; appear - these are _actants_ possessing philosophical or psychological import. They also create and problematize narrative sub-structures within the work as a whole. (Such are Clara Hielo Internet, Tiffany, Alan, Travis, Honey, Nikuko, and others.)</P><P></P><P>The long-waves are fuzzy topics on such issues as death, love, virtual embodiment, the granularity of the real, and physical reality, which criss-cross the texts. The resulting fragments and coagulations emerge from code and codework, surface and substrate.</P><P></P><P>The writing encompasses, past and present, but wagers the future as well; the emphasis is on extended virtuality.  Read in any order, any direction. The text is resonant.</P><P></P><P>Usage:  The text in whole or in part may be distributed in any medium. Please give credit.
