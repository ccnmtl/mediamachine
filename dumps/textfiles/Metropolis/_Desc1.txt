It is important to say that many different versions of Metropolis have been released, including: <br>The original 1926 black and white version (no longer exists); <br>The version subsequently released in the USA received a lot of cuts, and was only 63-minute long. Some of the lost scenes have been added to the restorations (see bellow), but some scenes have disappeared forever; <br>A B&W 90-minute long version was re-released in German in 1927 or 1928, and it is called the '28 German version; <br><br>There were also at least three restorations: <br>by East German "Staatliches Filmarchiv" by the end of the 1960s (see note); <br>by Giorgio Moroder, released in 1984, with colors, sound effects and a modern soundtrack. Moroder's version, despite being one of the most complete, has one of shortest run times. See the reasons here; <br>by Filmmuseum Munich, from 1995, restored according to the original script, with the lost scenes replaced either with stills or titles. It is reported that it has also totally "new" scenes that doesn't appear on any other version, and to have been produced in 3 sub-versions.<br><br>There is also a false restoration: <br>JEF Films calls its B&W 139-minute long release "newly restored version". But there is nothing restored in it. It has more missing scenes than any other available version, and image quality is the worst of all. This version runs in very low speed, all that's why it is so long. <br>There are some versions of Metropolis available at video stores. You may find the versions corresponding to the numbers 3 and 7. If you would like to order one of them, you would better visit this page before. For me, the many different soundtracks, as well as the differences in movie speed and in the number of missing scenes, make each version actually a different movie. That's why I think that one can not say that he liked (or did not like) Metropolis without specifying what specific version he saw. <br><br>Undoubtedly, Moroder's restoration was a rather controversial one. Many people loved it, but many people hated it. I'm in the first group. Moroder's version of Metropolis is my favorite movie, and Moroder's soundtrack is my favorite soundtrack ever. <br><br>1927
