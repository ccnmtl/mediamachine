Lang&#39;s masterpiece (not the MTV version) is an apocalyptic fantasy about a futuristic metropolis filled with dystopian foreboding. <br><br>As in H.G.Wells&#39; &#34;Time Machine,&#34; there is a radical stratification of life: the elites in white and the laborers in dark. It is a fully mechanized society, although degraded physical labor is necessary to mind the machines. The movie subjects this kind of exploitative semi-automation to a thoroughgoing humanist critique, using the expressionist lighting and camera work for which early German films, and then later Orson Welles, are so famous.  <br><br>We see a concerned aristocrat take pity on an exhausted laborer, not only replacing him but effectively taking on his very identity -- he even dons the laborer&#39;s number. Through his experience as an extension of the machine, he crosses over to their side in the class conflict.<br><br>Meanwhile, John Fredersen, an aristocratic scientist, pays a visit to the house of the mad inventor, Rotwang, who shows him the robot he has created to replace the fallible human workers. Rotwang sacrificed his hand in the course of his experimentations, but deems it a small price to pay for his final success. (jmb)<br>
