A condensed version of lifespan developmental psychology, in purely visual terms, in which life is actually very short indeed. It is the proverbial &#34;womb to tomb&#34; trip, in media terms from &#34;Nine Months&#34; to &#34;Six Feet Under.&#34; This prize-quality ad shows the ageing process graphically, though using a number of sneaky montage shortcuts, much like the rapid ageing of Mel Gibson at the rather magical end of &#34; Forever Young&#34;.
    The satire on accelerated living (and accelerated everything) is reminiscent of Paul Virilio&#39;s complaint that we have become a society of speed, in which fundamental dimensions of social life are being collapsed into an immediate impulsive experience of sheer velocity (see his &#34;Speed and Politics&#34;). `Life is Short&#39; hardly makes any profound political comment, but what it adds, is the notion that this social acceleration limits, truncates, and effectively destroys the meaning of living.
    In addition, the image of development as ballistic trajectory, and little else -- of the body as projectile -- is surely a latent critique of hyperkinetic lifestyle and the ideology of success, and it may be no surprise that the gender of the protagonist here is male.
    The explosive mother who launches the child is left behind in a dramatic separation, but she gets effectively repressed by the rapid narrative flow.  There is some sympathy with her, shown in the expression of shock on her face.  But unconsciously, the imagery suggests her massive expulsive force -- her desire to see her baby grown up and gone so fierce that it brings her child to an untimely demise.
