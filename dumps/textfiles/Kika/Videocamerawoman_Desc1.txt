This wacky, sometimes shocking adult sex comedy, which often slips into soap opera, is set in contemporary Madrid.  It sports two prime roles for women.  Kika (Veronica Forque) is a free-spirited make-up artist with various men in her life.  Andrea Scarface (Victoria Abril) is an outrageously dressed roving reporter who hosts a tabloid reality TV show specializing in coverage of sensational, frightening criminal events.<br><br>In this scene, suitably and outrageoulsy garbed, she visits the house of her ex-husband and his stepfather (Peter Coyote) ostensibly to rent it, pending their sale of it, to stage a show there.
