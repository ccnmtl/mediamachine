In this clip, we meet the eccentric Grape family: Amy (Laura Harrington), the eldest daughter, Ellen (Mary Kate Shellhardt), a self-absorbed preteen, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio, his retarded brother, Momma (Darlene Cates), once a great beauty, now a seven hundred pound shut-in, and Gilbert himself (Johhny Depp), the narrator. The family dynamic is typified by Arnie's favorite game, which is to hide above all of their heads and demand to be found. It amuses no one and makes Momma request Gilbert and Amy, surrogate parents of the others, to see the ritual through to completion. (jlh)<br>
