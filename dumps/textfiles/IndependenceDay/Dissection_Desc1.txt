As scientists dissect an alien, it awakens and attacks them, taking Dr. Okun (played by Brent Spiner, &#34;Star Trek&#39;s&#34; Data) hostage psychically and physically. The creatures, says Okun, have thoughts of pure evil and they are parasites who consume the resources of a planet and then leave it for dead, moving on to the next victim civilization. <br><br>Upon hearing of this threat to their freedom, the President (Bill Pullman) and his posse of military advisors raise their weapons and simultaneously fill this creature full of bullets. The enemy, who represents &#34;pure evil,&#34; is the kind of luxury that can only exist in cinema or fiction. The fact that these creatures have unilaterally murdered humans and destroyed the land makes it simple for the viewer to hate them and root for their destruction by any means necessary. Does this ever happen in life? Are there ever such distinct and immutable boundaries? (jlh) <br>
