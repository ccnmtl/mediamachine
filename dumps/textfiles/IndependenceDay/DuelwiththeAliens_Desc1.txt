Fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) engages in a &#34;Star Wars&#34; style chase with attacking ships in this scene. Hiller&#39;s ferocious yet glib approach to his pursuers and toward the creature he encounters when he opens the cockpit of the ship he has defeated could be determined as hysteria, fearlessness or the film&#39;s use of comic relief after several grueling scenes of terrifying destruction and loss of life. How does Hiller&#39;s attitude coincide with our images of the military in film? Of African Americans in film? (jlh)
