In this clip, visitors from another planet destroy three of America&#39;s major cities. Skyscrapers are toppled, cars fly through the air and debris and flames puncutate the former urban landscapes. Amidst the destruction, a father puts his daughter to sleep in the safety of Air Force One and a mother rushes her son to safety. It is interesting that in cinema, we presume that attackers from another planet would naturally want to destroy American cities foremost. Further, as we envision the aftermath of such destruction, the world we construct resembles in some ways the conditions those who live in war torn countries experience everyday. The degrees of horror experienced after a tragedy such as this one, the methods of coping and rebuilding are explored in this film. The devestation, however, is the focus of this clip. (jlh)
