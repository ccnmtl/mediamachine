One of Egoyan's best, quirkiest stories, this one centers on the intricate drama genereated by the underworld intersection of four lives at an "exotic dance" joint (cf. the "Bada-Bing" venue of "The Sopranos" fame).<br><br>Elias Koteas (recently seen with Laura Dern and Steve Martin in the dental-noir "Novicain") plays the loquacious, though not entirely objectionable D. J., while Bruce Greenwood (TV's "Nowhere Man" and JKF in the recent "Nine Days") is the puzzling man who frequents the seamy strip club, clearly obsessed with one particular young table dancer (Mia Kirsher--striking, but never heard of since). She seems to play to his fantasies, even to the point of allowing him to break the house rules forbidding client/employee contact. Afterwards, the protagonist expresses his frustration and heartbreak in the symbolic doghouse of the men's room. (jmb)<br><br>
