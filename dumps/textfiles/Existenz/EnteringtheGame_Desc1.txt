Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Ted Pikul (Jude Law) prepare to play Existenz, a virtual reality game that is played through images generated by an organic port implanted in the game players' bodies. Allegra, the developer of the game, has recently been attacked by an obsessive fan at a focus group so she recruits Ted as her bodyguard and gaming partner in order to test her damaged port. <br><br>In this clip Allegra convinces Ted to play Existenz with her, which entails the insertion of a bioport into his back so that he can join her in the virtual reality generated by the game. Ted is hesitant to play with the inventor of the game, to enter into a competition that he seems unlikely to win. The fact that Allegra appears to have more control, or at least more confidence, entering into this uncertain virtual environment seems significant, and that she has to coax him into allowing her to alter his body and his consciousness.
