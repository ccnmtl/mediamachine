In this clip, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), developer of the celebrated virtual reality game Existenz, and Ted Pikul (Jude Law) enter into a virtual arcade, where customers can play virtual reality games and buy accoutrements necessary for gaming. Although the environment seems true to reality, the character D' Arcy Nader (Robert A. Silverman) provides us with a glimpse of the shortcomings of Allegra's creation as he incorrectly orders statements in a conversation with Ted.<br><br>Beyond having rules, the world of Existenz also seems to have a culture that differs somewhat from the one in which we generally exist. A place where it is acceptable for someone to be possessed by their environment and provoked to speak certain phrases or where artificially generated characters enter a sort of mental idling, or "game loop," seems like one that maintains enough similarity to yet is subtly variant enough from real life to become completely fascinating to those who enter.
