A skeptical, contemporary, military buddy flick of sorts, echoing some of the post-apocalyptic iconology of Mad Max and the Road Warrior. It presents a unique vision of the bleak surreality of the Gulf war and its effects. <br>	It does so via the mercenary adventurism of four (later, three) rogue soldiers (George Clooney, in charge, and Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze under his command) at the conclusion of the war. Exploring and inventing its aftermath, they seem unclear about how to leave without extracting some reward for their risks and sacrifices.<br>	The action, writing, bright cinematography, and creative special effects conspire to expose unexpected dimensions and metaphorical potentials of warfare, enmity, occupation, the desert, and life and death situations. Interesting emphases on and interconnections among masculinity, ethnicity, the body, ballistics, and (perhaps surprisingly) ethical humanitarianism.<br>	Lively, hip imagery and montage, raising MTV color, kinetics, and shock to a new aesthetic level. Bill Clinton's favorite recent movie: perhaps because the U.S. military looks so bad, while American fighting men, even the cynical ones, seem somehow redeemed; or perhaps because it foreshadows NATO's narrow squeak getting out of Yugoslavia.<br><br>
