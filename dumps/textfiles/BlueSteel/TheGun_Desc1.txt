Curtis is at her best in the early scenes, as a rookie cop who has just graduated from the Police Academy in New York and handles her new job on the streets with humor and pride. For a while the movie addresses itself to the new insights and discoveries of a nervous, lonely young woman who is suddenly perceived differently by everyone - parents, friends, potential boyfriends - because she has a badge and a gun.
