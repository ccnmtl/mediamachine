In a recent interview, Curtis semi-apologized for the outrageous violence of the final scenes, "where the movie becomes a little less real," and she mentioned a showdown with the director over Bigelow's insistence that Curtis use a .44 magnum. In the movie, she uses the less destructive .38, although Bigelow photographs it so lovingly that it threatens to crowd Curtis right out of the frame. (film.com)
