In this clip, Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) generates a virtual replica of his daughter, Altaira, using a machine known as the Plastic Educator. This device, presumably, was used by the society that existed on the planet Altair prior to the arrival of the human colonists that inhabited the planet until an angry creature devoured all but Morbius and his daughter. <br><br>The civilization that preceded them left behind relics of their technology, suggesting that they were a society even more advanced than the humans of Earth. Using the power of memory, they exercised their brains on such machines as the Plastic Educator, as Morbius demonstrates. The image he elicits from his mind to demonstrate the device to a group of military personnel is that of his own daughter, and to them this effigy seems just as real as the actual Altaira (although quite small). Is this really Altaira or just her father's idealized image of his daughter brought to life? What are the ramifications of such a byproduct? Contrast Altaira in this form with Robbie the robot? Are they terribly different? <br>(jlh)<br>
