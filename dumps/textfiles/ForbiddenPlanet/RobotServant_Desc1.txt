MGM&#39;s first big-budget science fiction film, Forbidden Planet combined state-of-the-art special effects with a storyline based on Shakespeare&#39;s The Tempest. In the 23rd century, Cmdr. J. J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) guides United Planets cruiser C-57-D on a rescue mission to faraway planet Altair-4. Twenty years earlier, Earth ship Bellerophon disappeared while en route to Altair-4. Only the ship&#39;s philologist Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) survived; in the intervening decades, Morbius has created an Edenlike world of his own, for the benefit of himself and his nubile young daughter.  For many connoisseurs of science fiction, this 1950&#39;s pulp classic set the bar for the genre.
A group of scientists travel to the planet Altair to check on a colony of settlers from Earth that seems to have disappeared. When they arrive, they meet Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter, the sole survivors of an angry creature native to the planet.<br><br>In this clip we meet Robbie, a robot crafted by Morbius in his copious spare time prior to the demise of his entire community. We learn that Robbie is both a nurturing provider of protection and food and that he is incapable of harming his charges, the human inhabitants of the planet. Although Robbie&#39;s name, voice and physicality suggest maleness, he is very much a mother figure. The fact that his role is to protect and nourish the humans on Altair yet he is totally subject to their orders is also suggestive of a female gender role. Why would Morbius make a robot with this hodgepodge identity? Why might the filmmakers have made this choice? <br>(jlh)<br>
