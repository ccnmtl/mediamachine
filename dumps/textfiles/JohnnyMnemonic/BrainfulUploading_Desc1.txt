In this clip, Johnny Mnemonic (Keanu Reeves) has just received 320 gigabytes of information that he is to transport from Beijing to Newark. The crucial data, regarding the cure to NAS (Nerve Attenuation Syndrome), a disease form which almost half the population circa 2021 suffers, must be delivered to the Pharmakom Corporation lest its courier will die.<br><br>After the transmission of this data, Johnny, its carrier, has gone through a transformation himself. As the vessel in which this information will be carried, he becomes almost inhuman. The agents who transplant the data seem surprised that he would want to do something as banal as use the bathroom, and he is surprised to see his own blood in the sink. Meanwhile, flashes of the data he carries swim in his newly uploaded consciousness. (jlh)<br>
