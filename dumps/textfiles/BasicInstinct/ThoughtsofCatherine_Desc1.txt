&#34;Basic Instinct&#34; is perhaps best known for the controversial portrayl of the character Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), who is a novelist accused of killing her lover with an icepick, the same manner in which one of her protagonists had committed homocide. In this clip, Catherine&#39;s presence is limited to her hold over Nick (Michael Douglas), a police officer investigating the case, and his lover Beth (Jeanne Tripplehorn), a therapist. <br><br>After a violent bout of sex, Beth accuses Nick of acting out fantasies of Catherine. Beth knows that Nick had a meeting with her earlier that day yet she waits until after this meeting and their sexual interlude to reveal the fact that she knew Catherine in college. Why might Beth keep this information from Nick? Does her feeling of having information that Nick may want play a role in her willingness to participate in the violent sex that the two both appear to desire in this instance? How is the power of information equated with the power of female sexuality in this clip?<br><br>This film was protested extensively by lesbian activist groups, who claimed that it portrayed lesbians as homocidal hypersexual maniacs, and criticized by heterosexual feminists for its portrayal of women. Does this clip provide support for either of these cases? (jlh)
