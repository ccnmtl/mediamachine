Breckin Meyer stars as Josh, who's been in love with Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) since they were kids. He's committed to her - except for a college fling with sexually aggressive Beth (Amy Smart). But his infidelity was recorded on videotape - and that tape has been accidentally mailed to Tiffany. Which necessitates a spontaneous, desperate three-day, 1,800-mile road trip from Ithaca, New York, to Austin, Texas, to intercept the incriminating sexcapade and save his romance. He's accompanied by his bumbling best-friend, played by Seann William Scott, plus pot-smoking Paulo Costanzo and the requisite nerdy-guy-with-the-car, DK Qualls. So much for plot. MTV comedian Tom Green serves as the cryptic narrator/tour guide named Barry Manilow. (That moniker is typical of the lame humor.) Co-writer/director Todd Phillips wallows in the gross, crude antics as the four guys in a Taurus experience all the gratuitous nudity (a.k.a. bare breasts) their testosterone levels can conjure up.
