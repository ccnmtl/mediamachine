The opening of David Lynch's 1986 film, (excerpted here) shows the violence behind placid doors and on the front lawns of suburbia. The dark subtext of the film is clear at the conclusion of this clip.  At the end, with insects engaged in a death struggle, Lynch's distinctive style meets a canny sense of timing on the front yards of American life.  Lynch links violence with chance, television, and gardening.  <br>
