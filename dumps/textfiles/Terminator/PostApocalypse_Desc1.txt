Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of cowriter/director James Cameron - who would go on to make 1997&#39;s titanic Titanic - and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic 2029, when Los Angeles has been largely reduced to rubble and is under the thumb of all-powerful ruling machines. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two &#34;Sarah Connors&#34; who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared &#34;I&#39;ll be baaaack&#34; - and back he was, in &#34;kinder and gentler&#34; form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). - Hal Erickson (allmovie.com)
