On the verge of starvation in 1930s Paris, erstwhile entertainer Victoria (Julie Andrews) is rescued by gay cabaret performer Toddy (Robert Preston). What she needs to succeed, opines Toddy, is a gimmick.  What if she becomes a male impersonator? Better still: what if she becomes a male impersonator, pretending to be a female impersonator?  As &#34;Victor/Victoria,&#34; s/he becomes the toast of Paris, and an object of fascination for big-time Chicago gangster King Marchan (James Garner), who can&#39;t quite understand the teasing sensations he experiences whenever watching her in action-especially since he, like everyone else, assumes that she is a he.  Enjoyable though the stars of Blake Edwards&#39; comedy may be, the film is stolen by Lesley Ann Warren, who won an Oscar nomination as King&#39;s screechy-voiced moll, and Alex Karras as King&#39;s chief henchman, who, assuming that his boss is &#34;that way,&#34; literally comes out of the closet.  Victor/Victoria was a remake of the 1931 German film &#34;Viktor und Viktoria&#34;, which had previously been reworked in 1937 as the Jessie Mathews vehicle &#34;First a Girl&#34;.   In 1996, Victor/Victoria was transformed into a Broadway musical, again directed by Edwards and starring Andrews. -- Hal Erickson (allmovie.com)
