The film Star Wars in and of itself is something of a cultural phenomenon. Since its release in 1977, fans became obsessed with the film, its two sequels and one prequel released over twenty years later. The plot is a simple one. An orphan, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), is faced with a choice between taking a self-indulgent path through life or following in the footsteps of a paternalistic mentor in the fight for justice against an imperialistic power. Along the way he meets his long lost twin sister, Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer) and his father, who chose to follow &#34;the dark side&#34; and becomes his arch nemesis. <br><br>-JMB
