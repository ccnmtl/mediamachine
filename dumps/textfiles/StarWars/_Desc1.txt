In this scene Luke, still a naive neophyte in the world of intergalactic battle, and the hardened and sarcastic Han Solo (Harrison Ford) shoot at Imperial fighters in pursuit of Princess Leia, who they have just rescued. Although this is a battle scene, in many ways it is also a sort of courtship of the princess. Both men are displaying their masculinity as they shoot with large weapons. Is it wrong to say that this scene is a metaphor for sex? The pulsating guns situated between the legs of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, the satellites that sense their presence in the area, the tension and anticipation and finally, the explosion. Meanwhile, androids provide comic relief. Do the droids have gender or sexual orientation in this scenario? What is their purpose in light of the sexual tension that exists in the Han, Luke and Leia triad?<br>-JMB
