Greenaway uses, as a thread to link the various abstractly relayed segments of the Tempest plot, Prospero&#39;s library of supernatural books. Here, with exquisite graphics and calligraphy, they are displayed in turn, each capable of shifting alchemically from text or image directly to referent without any intervening concept or &#34;signified.&#34; The narrator announces them proudly in turn, like the curator of exhibitions, which is of course precisely one of Greenaway&#39;s major occupations. <br>	Finally, as the plot reaches its climax, the books -- all reduced to dry and dusty text now -- are closed emphatically, and then destroyed apocalyptically, in a counter-Enlightenment testimony to the dispensability of official knowledge.<br><br><br>	The brief, repeated images seem to stress the reversible transformations between dead word and living being -- the quiet, dry land of Prospero&#39;s island retreat and the moist medium of his oceanic turbulence. Greenaway can be taken as alluding here, in the context of a high-tech, post-Thatcher Europe, to the magical quality that contemporary technologies of literacy both deny and reinscribe. <br><br>-JMB
