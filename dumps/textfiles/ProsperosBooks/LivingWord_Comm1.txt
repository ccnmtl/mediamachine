<br>This heady technical display by an English writer/director who is also an accomplished curator and art historian is, like &#34;Forbidden Planet,&#34; a recasting of Shakespeare&#39;s &#34;Tempest.&#34; Here, the director continues his obsessive preoccupation with the very highest works of high European literature (cf. his version of Dante&#39;s &#34;Inferno&#34;) -- an unpopular focus on the canon at a time when multiculturalism and diversity are the watchwords. <br>	&#34;Prospero&#39;s Books&#34; resembles an extended high art reverie on the elemental furniture of the world -- animal, vegetable and mineral, earth, wind, water and fire -- cast in medieval and Elizabethan terms. It takes the spare, lugubrious, stylized, yet stirring form of an oratorical tour de force of nonagenarian John Geilgud as Prospero, bent upon revenge. The oceanic flow of imagery unpacks the cultural density and subjective convolutions of a man&#39;s considered and elaborate retribution for past injuries.<br>	 This against a background of lavishly and meticulously staged tableaux vivants of naked Scandinavian bodies voguing amid soaring columns and suffocating brocade, constantly confronted with ripe fruit, sumptuous haute cuisine, and prancing, posturing cherubs galore. The waves of prolix elements are orchestrated compulsively in gymnastic and terpsichorean filigrees, to Michael Nyman&#39;s  anachronistic minimalist score, with such a surfeit of gratuitous parading flesh as to numb the senses of Howard Stern, or perhaps even Robert Lifton.  <br>	But Greenaway is less an inveterate, ageing wanker than a postmodern exploiter of the multiplicative aesthetics of excess, which collapses traditional distinctions and fragments dramatic tropes into multimedia spectacles, demanding much more of the viewing audience than is usually asked. In the end, like Mickey Mouse, he seems to lose mastery over the forces of the deep, despite his desire to appropriate Shakespeare&#39;s magic hat.<br>-JMB
