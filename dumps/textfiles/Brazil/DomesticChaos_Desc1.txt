This nightmarish futuristic satire effectively blurs all lines between illusion and reality. Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowrey, a government statistician who chooses to blind himself to the decaying, drone-like world around him. Whenever real life becomes too oppressive, Sam fantasizes (to the tune of the 1940s big-band hit "Brazil") about being an alternate-world superhero, forever rescuing beautiful Jill Layton (Kim Greist). The omnipresent computer that controls everything in the "real" world malfunctions, causing the mistaken-identity assassination of an innocent citizen. When Sam routinely investigates the error, he meets Jill, literally the girl of his dreams. It turns out that she is an associate of a terrorist (Robert De Niro) whom the computer had originally intended to target for execution. The price Sam pays for tumbling to this fact is a close encounter with the man in charge of torturing troublesome citizens (Michael Palin). Does Sam escape his fate? Well....he thinks so. Director Terry Gilliam does too much very well in Brazil (a typically excessive moment is the hilarious plastic-surgery treatment given Sam's mother, played by Katherine Helmond). The director's original 142-minute cut was whittled down under protest to 131 minutes for the US release but is now widely available. - Hal Erickson (allmovie.com)
