Off the &#34;Storytelling Giant&#34; album by the quintessential new music avant-gardists, driven by Byrne&#39;s artsy downtown surrealism, this track suggests a number of features of where U.S. art rock was going in the 80s, and indicates the parameters of postmodern MTV aesthetic, borrowed from and intertextually referring to a number of cultish aspects of high and popular culture, early modernist as well as late modernist art (Francis Bacon, daytime TV, advertising, Magritte, Edward Muuybridge).<br><br>-JMB
