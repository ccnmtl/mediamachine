* Chaplin is echoing a longstanding tradition of criticisms of the `rationalization' of labor under modernism, dating back to Max Weber and others. What particular part of that critique does he elaborate here?<br><br>* Some of the critique seems to be directed against automation, some against exploitation, some against mechanical production, some against management, and some against industrialism in general.  Which part of the clip bears on which, how are the various critiques linked cinematically, and what do the transitions and segues imply?<br><br>* What in particular is being said about the male body in this segment?  Compare the topless guy who supervises the pulling of levers -- the instrument of automation.  Why is he topless, and what does it signify that his half naked torso is viewed from above by the fully clothed patriarchal boss?<br><br>* The setting and kind of work now seem arcane and even fantastic, in the context of the disappearance of manual labor and the increasing dominance of white collar work. How would you alter the story line of the excerpt just viewed to bring it up to date? In the contemporary context, what would be funny and why?<br><br>* Why and how is comedy an effective tool for fostering social criticism? Could comedy be used pedagogically in the classroom?<br><br>* Comedy uses extreme events and situations. What might the conceptual significance of extremes or 'excess" be, and hence their educational potential?<br><br>* Why is being fed so central to this scene?<br><br>* Can viewing such a critique of working class work backfire and seem to lionize middle class, non-manual work?<br><br>* Are fictional, futuristic films, with their imaginative "what if?", more or less effective than gritty realist movies about the present or historical exposes of past injustice?  Does the projection into the future allow the filmic treatment to be more extreme in its dystopian portrayal (cf. `Fahrenheit 451' or E.M.Forster's short story, `The Machine Stops'?), or does it make it all seem fantastic rather than real?<br><br>
