Charlie works on the production line in an automobile factory. A mere cog in the wheel, the Little Tramp faces all the dehumanizing practices of mechanization. <br><br>"What he presents us with is the proletarian still blind and mystified, defined by the immediate character of his needs, and his total alienation at the hands of his masters (the employers and the police)."<br>	-Roland barthes - 'The poor and the proletariat,' in Mythologies (1977), p.39.<br><br>This particular clip shows the unanticipated results of a scheme developed by scientists for management, in which workers are spared the time wastage of meal breaks by having their feeding incorporated into a supposedly sophisticated mechanical process. <br><br>"For Chaplin, the proletarian is still the man who is hungry; the representations of hunger are always epic with him. . . . Ironically, the food-dispensing machine (which is part of the employers' world) delivers only fragmented and obviously flavorless  nutriment." (ibid.)<br><br>Despite the satirical style, Charlie the character exhibits staunch perseverance and apparent trust in authority combined with the deadpan sangfroid of a Stan Laurel. He is the violated, masochistic clown, the victim of slapstick cruelty, in the tradition of circus and vaudeville.  "Chaplin portrays a kind of primitive proletarian, still outside Revolution." (ibid).<br><br>At the same time, the managers and scientists come across as not only manipulative and patronizing but also incompetent and pretentious. The class distinction within the workplace is emphasized, as is the lack of interest of management in the worker as a human being.  At the same time there is an assault on the notions of rationality and efficiency: the mechanisms of control are themselves out of control.<br><br>While the form and process of work in the factory is much like that in the standard factory of its time, the scenography of the work environment is quite futuristic, and so echoes the aesthetic science-fictionism of `Metropolis.'  <br><br>This particular clip shows the unanticipated results of a scheme developed by scientists for management, in which workers are spared the time wastage of meal breaks by having their feeding incorporated into a supposedly sophisticated mechanical process. <br>-JMB<br>
