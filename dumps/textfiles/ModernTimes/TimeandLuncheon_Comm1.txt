"For Chaplin, the proletarian is still the man who is<br>	 hungry; the representations of hunger are always epic<br>	 with him. ... Ironically the food-dispensing machine<br>	 (which is part of the employers' world) delivers only<br>	 fragmented and obviously flavorless nutriment." (ibid.)<br><br>	Despite the satirical style of the movie, Charlie the character exhibits staunch perseverance and apparent trust in authority combined with the deadpan sangfroid of a Stan Laurel. He is the violated, masochistic clown, the victim of slapstick cruelty, in the tradition of circus and vaudeville.  "Chaplin portrays a kind of primitive proletarian, still outside Revolution." (ibid.)<br>	At the same time, the managers and scientists come across as not only manipulative and patronizing but also incompetent and pretentious.  The class distinction within the workplace is emphasized, as is the lack of interest of management in the worker as a human being.  At the same time there is an assault on the notions of rationality and efficiency: the mechanisms of control are themselves out of control.<br>	While the form and process of work in the factory is much like that in the standard factory of its time, the scenography of the work environment is quite futuristic, and so echoes the aesthetic science-fictionism of `Metropolis.'<br>	Although we are used to Chaplin's political critiques from other movies, such as `The Great Dictator,' it is remarkable that he was able to mount such a versatile and penetrating criticism of labor practices nearly 70 years ago.  Some of his concerns about the mechanization of work and the dangers of automation were theorized by scholars as early as the 20s and 30s. These reactions against Taylorism or "time and motion" studies in the workplace were important forerunners of Chaplin's cinematic revolt, and one wonders if this rather literate man may not have been quite conversant with them.  <br>	`Modern Times' foreshadows other critiques of industrialism and labor exploitation, such as `I'm All Right Jack,' `Women in Love,' `Brassed Off,' and `The Full Monty' -- the British tradition of critical, and rather socialist, films about the exploitation of labor.  Also arguably influenced by Chaplin's work are studies of stress and danger to the operators of heavy machinery, such as `Dancer in the Dark.'  <br>	A more far-fetched connection might be Clouzot's `Wages of Fear' or Pontecorvo's `Wide Blue Road,' both from the 50s.  It is perhaps understandable that such commentaries on the dangerous conditions of work would emerge in the post-war era, despite the disillusionment about socialism.  But it may be suprising to some that movies of conscience about industrial labor conditions haunt even the post-industrial era.  However there are some changes: note, for example, how recent films about work tend to focus on the personalities and inner conflicts of the disenfranchized man, not on the dehumanizing process of work under industrial production. <br>The disenfranchized woman has not been so widely noted or commented upon, although `Nurse Betty' might be taken as an exception.	<br>	The particular role of comedy and, in particular, physical comedy in such social commentary is marked.  Obviously, in silent film, the vicissitudes of the human body are more likely to work as the medium of dramatic action than after the advent of sound film.  The proximity of silent film to the burlesk era, with its dramatization of male humiliation for the working (and drinking) man, may contribute to the slapstick physicality of the diegesis. The acerbic wit of Modern Times can be contrasted with the mild approbation toward physical labor in Disney style movies such as `Mary Poppins' and `Oliver.'<br>-JMB
