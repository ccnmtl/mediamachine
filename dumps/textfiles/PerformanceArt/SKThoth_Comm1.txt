A truly unique, maverick performer, surprisingly nimble for his 40 odd years. He appears to combine medieval jester, shower singing multivocal operetta, whirling dervish, and one man band?raising issues of popcultural hybridity as well as hybridizing of low with both high culture and folk culture, possibly also ethnic culture?</P><P>    Some may link Thoth&#39;s art to that of the downtown Talking Band, who do serious educational musical theater while playing instruments, banging on their own bodies, etc.  Or with the intellectual performances of Mick Taussig (Anthropology, CU), who bangs obscure South American instruments while lecturing.</P><P>    He was caught on videotape by David Garfinkel (TC alum) while strolling thru Central Park -- a flaneuresque urban experience in the Benjamin/Baudelaire tradition.</P><P>    Why are parks scenes for such urban outcroppings and why is the mixing of genres and levels of culture so appealing, absorbing, and challenging?
