In this film, written and directed by Stephen King, the machines on Earth turn against their creators when the planet spends three days languishing in the trail of a mysterious comet. This clip depicts trucks banding together to terrorize the patrons of a rural truck stop. The man who is killed by the toy truck (a typical horror-film style juxtaposition of saccharine and evil), just prior to his death, is attempting to sell insurance to two little old ladies by invoking the Bible as an example of the indispensability of such a purchase. Is he selling them insurance against something or assurances of something? How does this play with the impending attack of 18-wheelers that awaits the salesman in the parking lot? (jlh)
