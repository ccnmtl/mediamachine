The morning after a night of terror at the mercy of a pack of 18-wheeler trucks, the patrons and employees of the Dixie Boy Truck Stop emerge from their respective entanglements to find a new menace in the form of two new machines that have come to kill them. Wanda, the waitress, (Ellen McElduff) is incredulous and angry that these machines, created by humans, could turn against us. The lack of loyalty these machines show is not unlike the behavior of replicants or cyborgs who have been enslaved by humans to do undesirable work in other films; however, the connection is less tangible when the machines in revolt do not even remotely resemble the human form. When the tank enabled with a machine gun growls at its prey, given its animistic qualities, Wanda seems less insane for trying to reason with it. (jlh)
