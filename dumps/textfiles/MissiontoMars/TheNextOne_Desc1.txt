This is one a of a slew of millennial space travel/aliens movies that appeared in or around 2000 (cf. "The Red Planet," "Deep Space," "Pitch Black," "Contact," etc., but not "Galaxy Quest" or "Lost in Space") that were about exploration and post-colonial encounters rather than the "War of the Worlds" type movies where aliens threaten the Earth, as in "Mars Attacks," "Independence Day," or "Alien Resurrection," or seek to reform us, as in "The Day the Earth Stood Still." <br><br>In this one -- perhaps more Spielbergian and mystical than the rest of the recent bunch (cf. "2001" and "Event Horizon") -- a team of astronauts lands on Mars but runs into trouble. They can still escape back to Earth, but their time is running out. Meanwhile they encounter what appears to be a monumental stone face lying in the desert sand, which lures them into a risky side-trip. It turns out to be the veritable face that launched a thousand ships ...<br><br>Distracted by the mysterious and powerful presence of the massive, incongruous face-thing, they decide to risk a quick reconnaissance, but run into something quite unexpected.<br>It may be worth checking out the related "Quatermass and the Pit," a scary British TV movie from the late 50s, which is arguably the first to make the evolutionary link between Earth and Mars.
