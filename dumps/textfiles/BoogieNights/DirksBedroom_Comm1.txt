In this clip, we see Eddie Adams (Mark Whalberg) in his natural habitat: his bedroom. As this yet-undiscovered porn star undresses for bed, the camera gives us a 360-degree view of his lair. The walls are plastered with posters of sexually charged images: Farrah Fawcett in her heyday, corvettes, slick-bodied women clad in bikinis, Al Pacino as Serpico, Bruce Lee, and of course, the camera pans across the large bulge in Eddie's trousers. He admires himself in the mirror, timidly at first, and then trying out a few Lee-style karate jabs and punches. At this point in the film, Eddie has not yet assumed his pseudonym "Dirk Diggler," and he exhibits a boyish naivet‚ that seems almost out of place in this bedroom. His manhood as symbolized by his giant penis, which Eddie regards as his ticket to fame, is something that he reveres more than he understands.<br>-JMB
