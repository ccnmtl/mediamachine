Eddie Adams is a high school student with ambitions of making it in show business. However, at the beginning of the film, we find Eddie washing dishes at a local restaurant. Naive, hardworking, earnest Eddie transforms into his alter-ego Dirk Diggler upon entering his bedroom, laden with images of women in bikinis, fast cars and icons of masculinity circa the late 1970's. Dirk Diggler wants to make the world a better place through pornographic films.<br><br>In this scene, we see Eddie transform into Dirk as he stands before his bedroom mirror taking stock of his physical appearance and shadow boxing. He relates to his penis as if it were not a body part, but rather another individual altogether. How do the images that surround Eddie, which suggest idealized portraits of male and female beauty and sexuality, influence the development of his self-concept? How does he transform from the moment of his entry into his bedroom to the end of the clip? What might this indicate about Eddie's transformation into Dirk? (jlh)<br>
