When Eddie Adams (Mark Whalberg) returns home from an evening out, his mother (Joanna Gleason) waits for him in a darkened room, ready to berate him for staying out all night, for sleeping with his girlfriend who she deems a slut and for generally being stupid. Eddie, horrified by his mother's accusations, leaves his mother's home feeling dejected; however, as he exits their dark ranch house for the bright morning, the viewer has a sense that Eddie's prophecy to his mother may be true. Perhaps he will make something of himself.<br><br>Why is Eddie's mother so enraged by her son's blossoming sexuality? Why does she use it as a weapon against him, as proof positive that he is stupid and incapable of caring for himself? Ironically, it is this very trait that Eddie is able to exploit to become the porn star Dirk Diggler. (jlh)<br>
