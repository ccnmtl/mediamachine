A spellbinding, romantic, ecological docu-extravaganza. It examines critically--with sublime slo-mo, time-lapse, and minimalist Glass score--the way the speedy man-made world in the U. S. exploits, disrespects, and devastates the rich potential of the gradual natural world. It is perhaps the ultimate celluloid representation of Native American sensibility, a subtle revenge for the depradations of John Wayne and other spiteful cowboy colonizers.<br><br>The camera admires the magnificent, powerful, coherent space rocket at take-off, but then gets distracted by the sensually and conceptually fascinating appearance of abjectness in a piece of burning booster debris that is jettisoned and plunges with exquisite grace to earth.
