The title in Hopi means "life out of balance," and the warning statement at the end of the movie seems oddly prescient:<br>	"Near the Day of Purification there will be cobwebs spun<br>	 back and forth in the sky. ... A container of ashes might<br>	 one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land."<br>	See also by the same director the subsequent "Powaqqatsi" (1988), which is a critical but sensuous look at the exploitation of the third world.<br><br>The camera admires the magnificent, powerful, coherent space rocket at take-off, but then gets distracted by the sensually and conceptually fascinating appearance of abjectness in a piece of burning booster debris that is jettisoned and plunges with exquisite grace to earth. <br><br>A Lacanian might say that the grand image of objectively powerful technology -- both holistic and hostile -- is offensive as well as defensive: it is experienced at first (before its transit into the symbolic order) as attacking and dismembering the natural, body, leaving us subjectively in fragments -- a kind of "piece education," if you like. <br><br>What Reggio adds to this is the alignment of the full, universal imago with the upward vertical trajectory (projection), while the concealed fear against which this defends is the downwardly mobile particular (Kristeva's abjection). In dwelling cinematically on the latter, and allowing its suppressed beauty to be revealed, he deconstructs the dualistic hierarchy of "up" over "down." A similar goal seems to be imbedded in narratives of the "Prince and the Pauper" variety (cf. Buck-Morss chapter in my 1987 book).<br><br>In consequence, Reggio places the superior under erasure, prefiguring the eventual and inevitably ruinous fall of a vertically propulsive technology, and suggests how the pure motive of scientific exploration may in fact be related to the hubristic military objectives of destruction (the "container of ashes"). We might say that the damage potentially done to the other, in rudely piercing the sky, returns in the form of damage done to us even in the process of take-off, and which the foveal splendor of ascent distracts us from, leaving it behind as a pure cast-off, rendering it into ignorance.<br><br>Professor John Broughton
