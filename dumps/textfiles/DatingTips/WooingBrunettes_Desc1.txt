This instructive military video teaches young officers how to impress the ladies with a healthy dose of smugness and self-importance. <br><br>Here's the spoiler, so stop reading here and watch the clip if you are so inclined. This clip is actually the example of what NOT to do on a date, and in the actual military video this scene is followed by one that shows a more polite and chivalrous encounter between the same characters. <br><br>The question remains, why is the U.S. military producing such a video? What does this negative example presume about he behavior of servicemen on dates? (jlh)
