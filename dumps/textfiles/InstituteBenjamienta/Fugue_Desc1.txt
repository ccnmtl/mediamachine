This black & white British drama has the quality of a dark, oppressive and disturbing dream as it chronicles the experiences of Jakob Von Gunten who has come to the institute to train to become a manservant. The school&#39;s underlying purpose to imbue its graduates with a numbing sense of duty and obedience to their employers. The graduates come out as little more than human parrots, and young Von Gunten is too curious about the life outside the school to become a living automaton like his peers. He begins exploring the maze-like halls and dark corners of the enormous school and there encounters Johannes Benjamenta and his wrath-like sister, Fraulein Lisa. In time, Von Gunten is allowed to learn their darkest secrets-the secrets that expose them and their philosophies for the weak lies they are. The young man, uses that information to destroy the institute. The plot is adapted from the stories of Swiss writer Robert Walser. - Sandra Brennan (allmovie.com)
