Roy (John Cusak) and his mother, Lily (Angelica Huston), both con artists, are having a dispute about money, or so it appears. Lily asks Roy to consider the possibility of her not being his mother as she attempts to seduce him. The Oedipal tension that exists between them is apparent throughout the film and may be a result of the fact that Lily was just 14 years old when Roy was born and the two were raised as siblings by Lily's parents. But is it the money she wants from Roy, or is this just a euphamism for sex in their world of deceit? After the two share a kiss, Lily strikes Roy, causing a glass to fly from his hand, the shards cutting his throat and killing him. As her son bleeds to death, Lily moans beside him on the floor.
