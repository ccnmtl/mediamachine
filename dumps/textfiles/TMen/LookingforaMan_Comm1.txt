A classic crime melodrama of the late 40s, that qualifies marginally as a noir film, by a major American director (who has a special section for his work in uptown Kims!)  Although the movie also stars June Lockhart, the plot rotates around two Treasury Department detectives (the hero and someone called Lindsey, with whom he has worked successfully before). They are putting the heat on a gang of counterfeiters, starting with one hood who is reported to sport a scar on his shoulder.  The hero succeeds in counterfeiting himself, infiltrating the ring, but ends up on opposite sides from his ambiguously-named partner, who gets KOd -- a kind of Liebestod, in Fiedler&#39;s sense. The hero is steamed, and in tribute to his lost &#34;love&#34;, he dedicates the work to Lindsey, a kind of mourning melancholic process of identification, taking over the role of the other or merging with him.<br> <br>Note how crime dramas -- with their focus on multiple men in a world of men, largely excluding or at least trivializing women (as secretaries, femmes fatales, distractions from the plot, etc.) -- allow for many  symbolic father-son and adult homosocial relationships (cf. the Godfather series, or the Sopranos).<br>    <br>This particular movie is remarkable for its suppressed but intense homoerotic imagery, often quite explicit to a modern audience. Rob Maitra has noticed that this makes it an ideal example of Richard Dyer&#39;s analysis, although Dyer omitted it from his review.<br><br>Note, there is some disagreement about whether Mann directed this film -- Halliwell&#39;s Film Guide, for example, lists Aubrey Schenk instead, and dates it to a year earlier.<br>-JMB
