Several recent movies play rather explicitly on the vernacular male organ. Often this is relatively slight, as in the case of &#34;Dick Tracy.&#34; More commonly, it takes the form of a joke about &#34;private dicks&#34; or, in the terms of noted Columbia English professor, George Stade, the &#34;hard-boiled dick&#34; (with its contrapuntal allusion to the female equivalent, eggs). Then there is the straight on &#34;I Love Dick,&#34; the very declaration of which in public sounds disingenuous or even downright defensive (or perhaps gay?)  Most noticeable at the level of titles is the straightforward &#34;Dick,&#34; which suggested none too subtly that Nixon was one -- this being exposed by two young, nubile women who fetishized dogs. <br>	Most if not all of these movies play on the intuition that symbolizing the penis is in some way significant, and that the presence of the term &#34;dick,&#34; with its derogatory flavor, already leaks the inside story that the male penis may not be all its cracked up to be -- in fact, it may contain a certain potential for solecism and idiocy.  The movie &#34;Dick,&#34; in which Nixon is hilariously portrayed by the always quizzical Dan Hedeya, exaggerates the insubordination by showing that even the most powerful man in the world is scared of teenaged girls.  Such is the precarious state of the phallocracy.<br>	The latest in this series, &#34;Living Without Dick&#34; is not the lesbian, feminist, or ascetic feature that its title might at first suggest. The movie starts from and thereafter hinges largely on the notion, alluded to coyly in the title, that Colleen is a chick with a Dick. Note that she also carries a gun that turns out to be surprisingly potent -- mimicking, supplanting and then eliminating masculinity. <br>	It is unclear whether or not the title means that Colleen feels that without her philandering boyfriend she lacks sexual satisfaction. In fact, her need for constant intercourse would seem indic(k)ated by the fact that, despite her protestations, she starts working on another sexual relationship within hours or even minutes of killing her boyfriend, suggesting that life without dick is intolerable for her (cf. her role in &#34;Sex and the City&#34;?)  <br>	The fender bender is used at the start of Life Without Dick to prefigure an infidelity that actually precedes Colleen&#39;s awareness of Dick&#39;s infidelity. Is the movie somehow holding her responsible for his betrayal?  Or, rather, does she sense preternaturally the abandonment she is about to undergo, justifying her preparing herself for a substitute? After all, it is through the crystal ball of a fortune teller that the key information about Dick&#39;s adventures is first discovered.<br>	The fender bender is a kind of bodily collision, with damaging consequences to both parties, that both foreshadows the subsequent events in the comedy and registers the injury, loss, and abence sitting at the heart of sexual desire and the sexual relationship (cf. Zizek 19  ).<br>	However, rather than referring to Colleen&#39;s insatiability, the title may signal the more interesting fantasy that she has become implicated in castration. If her boyfriend himself was the dick for her, then is she the castrator (like the feminized Robocop, in the rape scene)? If so, has she castrated Dick or castrated herself (removing her own dick?)  <br>	Or is there a sly reference in the title to the rather impotent character played by Harry Connick (Daniel) -- who sings Danny Boy (suggesting immaturity) and cant kill anyone -- who therefore is a sub for Dick and could be said therefore to be by definition without Dick. Colleen removes the possibility of dick, which despite her appearance of instnat recovery leves a permanent scar on the sexual relationship with Daniel.<br>	In a sense, Dick&#39;s dead body is the lifeless phallus, both weighing them down and providing the occasion for their liaison (the copula) since it was via the argument between Dick and Daniel over a fender bender by which  Colleen met Daniel. That collision could be seen as an aggressive pissing contest, in which Daniel&#39;s graciousness (to attract Colleen) seems to give him momentarily the larger organ. On the other hand, there is a covert homoeroticism to the contact, with the phallic automobiles gently &#34;bending&#34; each other.<br>	In a sense, Colleen is conscious of her phallic role in the relationship with Dick. Aware of his infidelity (his &#34;crossing the road&#34;), she arms herself with what she is not getting, staking her right to it, or compensating herself for the loss thereof. She casually wields the phallic thing, knowing it is purely symbolic and has no power to actually harm him -- it is a pseudo-phallus (the woman signifies the phallus, in Lacan&#39;s terms). 	<br>	She thinks the gun has no bullets but the irony is that Dick has made the phallic symbol potent by putting a (phallic) bullet in there as a prank while she wasnt looking. What on earth was he thinking? It almost seems like a condemnation of self, a self-destructive symptom of his guilt at cheating on and abandoning her. On the other hand, putting one in her chamber (note it is only one bullet) is ambiguous: it could be said to signify one or more of three things.<br>	First, the repetition of his past acts of intercourse with her. Second, the Don Juanish fantay of surreptitiously stealing one last fuck before abandoning her -- a final insult and venal act of narcissistic self-assertion (cf. the killer&#39;s seduction of his victim, Sandra Bullock, in &#34;The Net&#34;). And third (since he sneaks the bullet in without her seeing) the unseen intercourse with the crossing guard. The fact that he conflates the three in one act suggests a condensation by which he reveals the extent to which any woman is merely a cipher, a pawn in a rotating game in which each woman is a substitute for another -- leading us back eventually to the original fantasized sexual relationship to his  own mother, the  positive  oedipal complex.<br>	All this priapism becomes funnier when we witness Dick&#39;s castration. Colleen shoots him through his guitar. But the evidence of the wound is that blood leaks out (not spurts out) through the hole in the instrument, and the fact that he looks at it in surprise as a teenage girl would at her first period, allows us to infer that his guitar is a representation of his actual genital state -- a thinly disguised vulva. He is that kind of Don Juan mother&#39;s boy who has retained such a strong identification with the mother he was unable to have that he has copied her bodily structure on to his own.<br>	If Colleen has indeed castrated him or revealed his underlying castrated state, she  could be said to have castrated herself and Dick at the same time. Far from the image of the young Irish colleen, fresh out of the hills, and virginal. Yet a life without dick is evocative of a virginal state, as indeed is Dick&#39;s first (and last) menstruation. Perhaps, as in Lacan&#39;s commentary on Poe&#39;s &#34;Purloined Letter,&#34; once Dick takes up the colleen&#39;s position, she no longer has to occupy it.  <br>	This is, then, the &#34;over-the-top fun,&#34; the &#34;brazenly wild and outrageously hilarious comedy&#34; that the advertising blurb for the video promises us. After all of which, one could be forgiven for looking forward to a life without &#34;Life Without Dick.&#34; -JMB<br>
