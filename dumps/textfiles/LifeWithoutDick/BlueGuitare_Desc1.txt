Late 20s schlock artist Colleen (the ubiquitous Sarah Jessica Parker) is a doormat for her early 30s boyfriend Dick (Ray Liotta look-alike, Johnny Knoxville), despite his boorish, philandering crankiness. But there is a critical incident in the &#34;Target&#34; parking lot when Dick backs clumsily into the ritzy car of Irish mafia hit-man Daniel (the egregious Harry Connick).  Dick starts to argue with him, and expects Colleen to stay out of it.  But she seems glad to have her fender bent -- she gives Daniel the come hither. <br><br>Later, she goes to see a fortune teller (Teri Garr, older but no less funny) who warns her that Dick is getting the old leg over a &#34;crossing guard,&#34; with whom he is leaving that day for foreign parts. Colleen confronts Dick with her knowledge and accidentally shoots him.  Scared that without Dick, she&#39;ll get life.<br><br>Daniel returns to ask her out, pretending to be an art dealer interested in buying her (awful) paintings.  He is a hit-man who can&#39;t seem to kill anyone, and so when he discovers that Colleen is hiding a body in the basement, it&#39;s a perfect match. <br><br>In this scene, Colleen confronts Dick about his philandering intentions while he is playing guitar (badly). She waves her lady-like gun at him, which she bought for token defence and keeps unloaded, hoping to intimidate him. She &#34;pretends to&#34; shoot him, as a sign of her displeasure. However, what she does not realise is that earlier, while she wasn&#39;t looking, Dick had put a bullet in it as a prank. This bullet passes through the hole in the guitar, into Dick&#39;s gut area, killing him, and we see the blood leak out of same hole as he is dying, with a rather surprised look on his handsome face. -JMB<br>
