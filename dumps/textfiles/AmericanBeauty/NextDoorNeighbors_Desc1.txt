The scene before this clip involves an argument between Jane (Thora Birch) and her mother Carolyn (Annette Benning). It begins with Carolyn&#39;s apology that Jane had to witness a fight between her parents that was not unlike a psychotic break for two and ends with Carolyn&#39;s bewildered exclamation that her daughter is ungrateful for her advantages; after all, when her mother was a girl she didn&#39;t even have a &#34;real house. We lived in a duplex!&#34;<br><br>The clip begins with Jane exposing herself to Ricky (Wes Bentley), as he tapes her and ends with Ricky&#39;s father leaving him, beaten and in a heap on the floor. Both Ricky and Jane have conflict with their parents. Ricky assumes the subservient tone of a buck private when addressing his father in order to subvert his actual personality. Jane, conversely, does not manipulate her identity in the same way. In this scene, she appears to be showing her vulnerability to Ricky by exposing her breasts to him, but also her power. Is she doing this to rebel against her mother or to assert her sexuality or to show her vulnerability? Perhaps a combination of all of these things, and certainly others. <br><br>Ricky&#39;s demeanor with his father is almost robotic. Notice the references to discipline and respect in this clip and then refer to the clip, &#34;Fathers&#34; for more background on the role of respect and discipline in the lives of Ricky and Jane.
