Ricky Fitz (Wes Bentley) and Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) are next-door neighbors. In this clip, they discuss their relationships with their fathers. In the beginning of the clip, Ricky is filming Jane, who takes the camera from him, in effect turning the lens on him for a while. <br><br>How do the two deal with their dislike for their fathers differently? Why does Jane&#39;s dislike of seeing herself on camera subside during this conversation?<br><br>Jane and Ricky joke about killing Jane&#39;s father while Ricky films her, yet after the camera is turned off, Jane must be reassured that he knows she was only kidding. What is the significance of the camera in this conversation, both when it is on and off? (jlh)<br><br>Note: brief nudity.
