Viewing only the facade of these neighbors&#39; morning routine, one would think that two happy families co-exist in suburban paradise. In reality, American Beauty is anything but such a tale. In this scene, Colonel Fitz (Chris Cooper) waves good-bye to his son Ricky (Wes Bently) yet watches suspiciously as Ricky greets the man next door, Lester Burnham, (Kevin Spacey) with congeniality and ease. Colonel Fitz then enters his son&#39;s room where he views with fascination a video of Lester lifting weights. <br><br>This scene is particularly complex because at this point in the film, Colonel Fitz&#39;s disapproval of his son is apparent but his reasons for his disdain of Ricky&#39;s relationship with Lester is unclear. One possibility is that he sees a young man and an older man who relate in a way that one never can with his own father. However, as Colonel Fitz watches Lester&#39;s workout with fascination, it becomes clear that his fixation is actually on his neighbor and not his son. Thus, whether the Colonel envies his son&#39;s replacement of him as a father figure or what he presumes to be his son&#39;s realization of his homosexuality, the tension between father and son, youth and adult, is cleverly engaged by the filmmakers.
