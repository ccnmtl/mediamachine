Colonel Fitz has misconstrued the furtive relationship between his son and his next door neighbor, Lester (Kevin Spacey) as one involving illicit sex instead of illicit substances. (Actually, Lester buys marijuana from Ricky Fitz.) In a state of disillusionment, the Colonel comes to Lester for comfort from his strained and violent position as tyrant in his home and misinterprets Lester's attempt to relate to the man as an invitation to physical intimacy.<br><br>In this scene, although the two men may be misunderstanding each other, a great deal is communicated about their ideas about masculinity, the ways it must be played out as a sex role and the facades that each one lives in order to maintain the image of being a certain type of patriarch, while in actuality, each man is something other than what he appears to be. In this moment of conversation, each one begins to reveal a piece of his actual self, and the results later in the film are volatile.<br><br>Why is the compassion of a man towards another man construed as homosexual advance while the same behavior by a woman would be considered mere kindness? Lester says his marriage is anything but normal, yet his family's disfunctions seem typical of American suburban life. What precisely is normal? What might their marriage be a commercial for?
